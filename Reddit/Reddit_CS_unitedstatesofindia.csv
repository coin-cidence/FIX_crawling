1dzn0he,Will AAP win the upcoming assembly elections?,"I have a feeling they wont.

A lot of their leaders are in jail - Double edged sword - Can give sympathy votes(because of ED IT misuse) or can dent their image and credibility. 

We definitely did not see the former happen in the lok sabha polls.

But more than that, I think the fact that they promised to “reduce pollution” , “provide water” , “maintain good infrastructure, especially during floods” have all fallen flat despite all these happening year after year..

Its been a lot of time AAP has been at power, yes I understand that BJP using LG interference considerably slows down their ability to execute..but have you seen their responses when asked about these issues? 

Just blame game and deflect the responsibility and give lame excuses…

I dont know maybe Im the only one to feel this way..

Im not a resident of Delhi and hence would like to know your opinions and viewpoints!

Just curious!",2024-07-10 04:34:21,"[""I won't be surprised if congress gain some seats and end up with double digit seats. It won't be a landslide for AAP like before but no chances of BJP forming a government."", 'In my opinion Congress will be the biggest gainer in all the upcoming elections.', 'AAP is the least Corrupt of them all.', 'I’m expecting a Congress comeback, which would be good considering the city was much better governed during the Sheila Dixit era.', 'Would be very tough.\n\nAs a Delhi voter, I won’t be voting for them.\n\nThey’ve become a party of up-Bihari migrants.\n\nThey’ve absolutely let go of the earlier settled Delhi residents (Punjabis, Jats, Baniyas).\n\nMy colony, which happens to be an upscale Punjabi dominated colony is getting encircled with slums.\nAnd not to forget, that the local councillors have made the MCD a bribe charging department.\n\nThe sanitation levels have gone down, roads are in bad shape, water supply is bad.\n\nOnly thing positive is the electricity, which is cheaper and continuous.\n\n\nI may end up voting for BJP or INC if the candidate is good.', ""If Kejriwal is not released sooner, expect Congress to make a surprise return. Do not be surprised if we see the thing with BRS being repeated with AAP with many members of BRS shifting to Congress. Folks like Sanjay Singh would be a good fit at Congress.  \n\nThe courts seem to have recognized AAP as a private company instead of a political party and has openly stated that they want to target AAP. So I will make the wildest prediction.\n\n1. AAP as a party will be officially done and closed, regardless of conviction or getting acquitted. Some of the party members like Raghav Chadda have been dead silent. Swati Malival's accusations has not helped the party in the slightest.(99% possible). \n\n2. With Congress seemingly returning to its 'umbrella party' way of working, **expect Arwind Kejriwal himself to join Congress** and even getting strong within the party and join the camp that doesn't support RaGa.(90% impossible) \n\n3. *The caveat being that if AAP members want to continue their political career.* So even if the second scenario doesn't go on, ala BRS scenario I was describing.  Prominent ones like Sanjay Singh will go to Congress. But it will be 50-50 split. Not a lot of them have issues with BJP's ideology, if AAP's silence on Delhi riots is to be considered.\n\nThat being said, I am expecting a BJP victory at Delhi assembly elections."", ""Anyone but the BJP should. Delhi Police being what it already is, and given what is done to the farmers at the borders, or students, if they come to power in Delhi, it will be a hell hole. They'll probably end up selling the whole city to big corp. \nBut given the trend in the Loksabha polls, I think it'll be BJP. Especially in the context of post-poll narrative turn, which is largely in favour of the INDIA bloc. If it continues, the middle class voter base of Delhi will probably offer a pushback. But again, it might not be that simple, there will be probably be a split in votes with some millennials and most of gen z standing against the BJP. Kind of depends on how seriously and how hard the INC tries to get Delhi. \n\nKejriwal barely has any reliable leaders left in their ranks. And they're so caught up with these court cases and legal issues, they're really neglecting civic duty and administration. I understand the relations are bad with the centre.

Sometimes a loss does wonders to you, I am sure people will notice the difference in work once bjp /congress comes in power anyways.

The longer he stays at jail, more loss in Party's morale. If Kejriwal gets out few months before the elections, situation won't be bleak. Kejriwal joining Congress and the party itself disintegrating will happen if and only if the courts go harder against AAP as an organization. Even I do not want AAP to go away, as it is the only non-orthodox party with far less connection to the pre-independence figures and politics."", 'correct', 'true, leadership problem is there many states.', 'Hmm then I guess they need to lose anyways. A loss will teach them a lot of things for future.  If bjp wins do you expect the situation to improve btw?', ""Well I'll atleast give you an upvote coz you did state your theories are truly wild"", 'Idk,whether anything would change or not.\n\nBut the politicians should always be treated as diapers.\n\nChange them when they get soiled.', 'Yup true that!']"
1dftq1j,Delhi LG approves prosecution of Arundhati Roy under UAPA in 2010 'provocative speeches' case,"A first information report against author Arundhati Roy and former Central University of Kashmir professor Sheikh Showkat Hussain was registered following orders of the court of metropolitan magistrate in New Delhi, PTI reported quoting unidentified Raj Niwas officials.

Roy and Hussain were booked based on a complaint filed on October 28, 2010, by Sushil Pandit, identified as a social activist from Kashmir.

Pandit had alleged that various speakers delivered provocative speeches on October 21, 2010, at a conference organised by the Committee for Release of Political Prisoners under the banner of ""Azadi - The only Way"".

One would be incorrect to argue that. Duress from who? Coercion and duress would be applicable if the Pakistanis had got the instrument of ascension signed. Not India. \n\n1B. Almost the entirety of princely states had rulers that were deeply unpopular and these states acceded to India and Pakistan under dodgy conditions. So does this make the entire nations invalid?\n\n2A. The ONLY relevant and fresh data available for judging faith of J&K citizens in India is the election turnout data which was convincingly at 58.6% \n\n2B. Which exact rights are being infringed here which is not a norm around the nation?', '1A. Duress can be if you don’t sign the instrument of accession right now, you can deal with Pakistani army yourself.\n\n2. Participation in the election in no way means support towards India. Elections impact people’s lives in the short term so, people will participate in them to have their issues heard.\n\n2B. Is AFSPA a norm in the rest of the nation?', '1A. It’s not duress, we couldn’t legally help Kashmir as if without a mutual defence treaty or ascension, it would be deemed an invasion by India. Coercion or duress would be us not honouring that treaty had a treaty been there. \n\n2. Absolutely it does. That’s why victory of separatist sympathiser and independent candidate Engineer Rashid and the two MPs accused of Pro Khalistan sentiments is a win for India. We as\nVoters have voted for an individual who has accepted and taken and oath to uphold the supremacy of the constitution and of the Indian state on his application form. A revolt would have been non inclusion and boycott of elections whereas in my constituency 23 Candidates took part and we saw record polling. This absolutely affirms faith of the people in the Indian State.\n\n3. AFSPA is a norm in all disturbed states. I also don’t buy the Naya Kashmir/ new normal propaganda. Militancy is still active here. \n\nAlso AFSPA is an act of parliament and does not infringe of any of the rights of citizens. It provides extra rights to the security forces.', '1A. Lol. \n2. Mega lol', 'Classic deflection on display by you. When you don’t have a reply just say Bharat Mata Ki Jay/ Takbeer/ lol and cut a sorry exit.', ""Lol, your answer deserved nothing more than lols. But, I'll reply just for the sake of it.\n\n1. So, you are telling me that a country cannot send its Army to help another except signing an instrument of accession? Did France sign an instrument to accede to US before the latter's soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy?\n\n2. You're again conflating the election results with support towards India. People go to elections to vote for leaders who they think can deal with the issues they face on a daily basis. Maybe they voted because they want their voice for independence be heard. Maybe they voted because they want electricity in their village. \n\nJust think for a moment. If everything was so well and good, why Article 370 was scrapped and they had to house arrest all Kashmiri leaders. They would be onboard with the Indian government, right, according to you.\n\n3. AFSPA does infringe on rights of innocent citizens if the said citizens are raped and murdered by Army men."", '1A. You are misquoting me, I said that country cannot send forces to help another country without an instrument of ascension OR a mutual defence treaty. \n\n1B. USA did not invade Normandy to help France. USA’s participation in European theatre WWII was a result of 1st Inter Allied conference, lend lease act etc. At the time an almost sovereign France did exist (Called Vichy France) which had acceded Normandy and north west France to Germany. USA went in as the Allies against Germany and on what was then German military administration. So your analogy falls flat. \n\n2. The election participation and that too record participation of 58.6% which is the largest in 35 years is in itself is the ONLY available metric by which you can judge the faith of the people in India. Since you’re fond of throwing anecdotal evidences in this argument I’d recommend checking out separatist social media handles on their views. K-twitter and r/Kashmiri literally urged people to boycott the elections but to no avail. \n\n3. I have already said that the Kashmir of 2007 was different, now the situation is drastically different. The question of 370, I’m on the same boat as all Kashmiris. Statehood must be ensured. The MPs and MLAs prior to 2019 had won on around 35% voter turnout, how can these people expect to have the mandate of the people. The 370 thing while bad was used to remove the bad apples who had made rotten the political system of the state. The recent result where Omar Abdullah was defeated convincingly by an independent candidate and defeat of other rulers of old like mahbooba mufti shows how people have rejected those Pre 2019 MPs. \n\n4. On the question of AFSPA. Please read the act before making these wild guesses. It doesn’t absolve murder, it doesn’t absolve rapes. Security forces when they go haywire and do immoral things do go to jail. Even they under AFSPA cannot detain anyone for more than 24 hours so habeas corpus is not infringed. All terrorists that are encountered by the Army are handed over to the police and court. Due process takes place to establish their identities and dates of joining in Tanzeems. Only then is the Army given a clean chit.\n\n\nAt the end you will believe what fits well with your own belief system and is soothing to yell in your echo chamber', '1A,1B. I see you’ve missed my point again. It’s quite simple. You can help people and send your army without it being deemed an invasion by the same people you’re trying to help, provided you’ve taken their consent. My analogy doesn’t fall at all. You can literally replace Germany with Pakistan, France with Kashmir and USA with India and everything holds true.\n \n2. No, you cannot just use any metric as being a proxy for Kashmiri support towards integration into India. I won’t argue with you about it because you have chosen to ivnore the overwhelming evidence that exists that Kashmiris want independence and are trying to shoehorn election voter turnout into being a proxy for that, which is stupid.\n\n3. Again, irrelevant to the discussion. Who wins or loses in election has no relation to Kashmiri views on independence, especially during times like now.\n\n4. Reading the act won’t change how it’s exercised in practise. All draconian laws are “legal” and mention safeguards to prevent misuse. But, in practise, those safeguards are blatantly ignored. If it was so safe, people wouldn’t have a problem with AFSPA. But, they do. Think about it. Why do they?', '1A, 1B - It is impossible to send your army to help anyone without an internationally binding agreement which could include a mutual defence treaty OR an instrument of ascension. Kashmir chose the ascension route.\n\nThe ‘France’ in 1944 consisted of a German installed puppet govt which had ceded the area of Normandy to Hitlers Germany. \n\n2. As I said, you choose to ignore the only available, historically accurate metric of peoples faith in the govt. ok, whatever helps you sleep at night. \n\n3. It absolutely does. Do you think that the 2 BJP MPs who have won have voters who want independence from the state?\n\n4. You are using vague language to cover your lack of knowledge on the subject. Can you exactly tell what fundamental right has been infringed and AFSPA has somehow magically saved the culprit? Law and its application doesn’t work on your perception of it. As I am a paralegal who works in a local court here I can possibly help you get a better understanding of the subject but that I believe is for another subReddit/ DM\n\n4B. Why people have an issue with AFSPA - it is partly due to the ignorance and media frenzy. The major issues that are clubbed along side AFSPA which are actually problematic are caused due to acts like PSA and UAPA. AFSPA in itself has little to nothing to do with the rights of the people of the state.']"

1cvfe5v,Swati Maliwal & my two cents,"# As the month began and Delhi LG pointed his finger at Swati Maliwal for irregularities in employee recruitment, it was only a matter of time that they would come for Arvind Kejriwal too. I anticipated that they will try to drive a wedge using Swati Maliwal to point finger at AK for the recruitments in exchange of cash. Alas, I was wrong.

  
However, when the news broke that she was assaulted by Arvind Kejriwal's PA, it was clear that BJP is making it filthy game. It's not for the first time that such things have been alleged by Delhi opposition/officials. In 2018, they tried to sabotage the functioning saying [bureaucrats were manhandled](https://scroll.in/latest/870141/delhi-chief-secretary-assault-aap-government-may-live-stream-meetings-with-officials). There was another case where a ""party worker"" woman tried to walk up the dais to meet the CM but on being stopped by his guards, claimed that she was sexually assaulted. Interestingly, she claimed this when the room was packed with other attendees. BJP as opposition did try to rake up the issue back then as well. (I am unable to find the link, maybe my keywords are not accurate)

  
In politics and war, its a common strategy not to target the person at helm, rather the people around them. Fidle Castro employed this strategy(FC advised to snipe down the second in command of the camp instead of the camp leader), its depicted in movies too (Gangs of wasseypur-Definite and Faizal). Manish Sisodia the closest AAP member was arrested on unfound charges, and long ago [AK's principal secretary too was charged with liquor smuggling:D](https://scroll.in/article/826947/first-person-arvind-kejriwals-principal-secretary-on-how-he-was-hounded-humiliated-and-maligned)

  
These attempts to malign an image by levying ridiculous charges makes me doubt Swati Maliwal's claim of being assaulted. Now, let me clear my stand that I am not downplaying victims of sexual assault per se, but this particular case at hand. Swati Maliwal is not a casual woman out for a stroll in the park when she was attacked. She was at the CM's residence. Mind you, she wasn't even ""[dragged 15 meters](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/out-on-night-inspection-swati-maliwal-dragged-by-car-for-15m-at-delhi-aiims/articleshow/97147720.cms)"" in the middle of night either (though its good that she highlighted the issue of safety). 



She knows what needs to be done incase of being assaulted:

>make a video on her own phone. (ok, now one might claim that who would think of pulling out the phone to record one's assault)  
>What about after the secretary went ""out of the room after assaulting & tearing her clothes""? Why didn't she record herself & her bruises right after she sat comfortably on the couch.

>She called the cops right? Cops should press release the call recordings and prove that she had been assaulted already by the time another bodyguard took the 50-sec clip. 

Why didn't she go straight to police station and then to hospital to get herself checked. Isn't she aware that these things needs to be done ASAP? She deals with such cases day in and day out she can't claim innocence. Three days delay..? Seriously!  
Her claim that she was dragged by her hair, falls flat after the release of CCTV footage by AAP of her being respectfully escorted out by Lady police. 

One might attempt to vouch that AAP gave press statement that she was misbehaved with. Mind you, misbehaved & assault are entirely different thing. When there is a verbal spat, he might have gave her back in her own language & even that is misbehaving, not assault (""Ganje saale, naukri kha jaungi"" were her words after all).

>Why can't AAP release the complete footage if they are innocent? Why should they do it before hand? Let her make more statements, let her make more follies only then the real footage should be released. Most of her claims so far had been proven wrong by strategic release of footage, so this should be continued.

It's time these ""politically motivated assaults"" are dealt strongly and AAP should remain strong on the face of such malafide charges. Truth will prevail & if Swati Maliwal is speaking the truth, then she should win this all cheers to her, but if not, she should be made an example to all those women who make others life hell through their false charges & she should be thrown back to the streets whence she came.",2024-05-19 03:55:25,"[""AAP's remaining major seat-fights are in Punjab (**13** on Poll Jun 1), Delhi & Haryana (**4 + 1** on Poll May 25); Assam(2) & Gujarat(2) polls over.\n\nIf AAP has further evidence, I'm expecting this drama until May-25 or Jun-1.\n\n---\nAK is a shrewd politician, his honesty however is disputed (by AAP's own past/present leaders)."", 'I had doubts cz I don\'t agree with the ""believe all woman"" idea but the moment they have started to release snippets of videos instead of the whole video, I started suspecting something.

16qrp37,Pesky brainwashing forwards from stooges like Sushant Sinha flooding society groups. Ideas to improve my approach?,"Hi, 

My family is being spammed videos of this guy by uncles from the society.

In typical whatsapp unkil fashion, they forward the video instead of its youtube link, so people can't read comments or conveniently share the video for its centralized debunking.

Given the amount of information (typically without sources), it's hard for 99% of the people to debunk it, and most of them just start agreeing to avoid being targeted. 

The latest is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmGf1Dj5nLg  (PM Narendra Modi का Bank वाला चमत्कार | Sushant Sinha | Latest News | India | Modi Reforms | LIVE)

I couldn't make the effort to debunk it pointwise, but just made a few quick checks to see what kind of a guy he is and found that:

Sushant Sinha (SuSi) is a typical Godi media anchor who cherrypicks stats and tries to give credit for other organization's achievements to Modi and shift the administration's blame away from Modi. He peddles lies, or modifications of the truth to create communal tensions.


1. https://www.altnews.in/false-claim-of-times-now-navbharat-and-bjp-spokespersons-targetting-ashok-gehlot-communal-profiling/ Here SuSi claimed that a Hindu lady's home was razed down in Alwar, Rajasthan. However, no action was taken against the shop situated right next to it called ‘Zakir Khan Mattress’. SuSi accused the administration of discrimination along communal lines. In reality ‘Zakir Khan Mattress’ is just a tenant in that building, whose owner is a Hindu man named Manish Dixit who is a lawyer by profession. Dixit's building itself is not unauthorized. But selectively picking information to make it look communal is what Godi people like Sushant do best

2. https://thelogicalindian.com/fact-check/journalist-ravish-kumar-ndtv-viral-video-24105
Another fake video misattributed to Ravish Kumar to tarnish his reputation, by Sushant Sinha.

3. https://youtu.be/V2txNQ4R28I?t=550
More examples of Sushant and other godis in action fooling Indians into believing Modi is a godlike figure respected globally.

11364q6,A Timeline of BJP turning from supporters of Delhi to powergrabbing till votes mean nothing anymore,"First they supported full statehood for Delhi, then stopped after they got nearly routed in 2015 and then did in their power to be a roadblock for the elected government they until recently advocated to be further empowered.

Then in 2018, Supreme court ruled that LG must act on advice of the elected government not the other way around, saying -

\>Thus, in this hue, the Constitution Bench has also accepted that the  Lieutenant Governor is to act on the aid and advice of the Council of  Ministers in all his acts, except those functions where the Lieutenant  Governor is permitted to exercise his own discretion

[The court also restricted the jurisdiction of the LG to matters  involving land, police, and public order, while holding that for all  other matters, he will have to act on the aid and advice of the council  of ministers.](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/centre-vs-delhi-govt-on-control-over-services-timeline-of-a-dispute-8380698/)

This leading to more project picking up pace and their 2nd embarrassing loss in 2020. Though they left the question of services up in the air after a split verdict. Services refers to power of appointing and transfer of the civil officers/bureaucrats that actually do everything behind the scenes. This case is going on in Supreme court right now and they recently reserved judgement and seemed to be leaning towards making the civil servants responsible to elected government instead of centre, [asking](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/why-elected-govt-in-delhi-if-full-control-with-you-sc-asks-centre-8378905/)

\> what is the purpose of having an elected government in Delhi at all if  the administration is to be carried out only at the beck and call of the Central government

Though Centre again tried to delay this after things weren't going their by asking for the case to be reffered to a large bench a second on the last day of hearings.

And then in 2021, they made it the law that the LG is the top dog in Delhi, completely going against the 2018 ruling and their previous stance on Delhi's democratic process.

That act gave power to the LG to stop ANY thing from passing, Delhi gov. cannot make any committees, it doesn't require their approval for any prosecution sanctions and importantly they are the ones picking the aldermans for MCD anymore because they are not Delhi gov. anymore at all. According to the new act the title Delhi gov. itself refers  to the LG.

And you probably didn't hear about it but it hasn't been for nothing either, [Here's examples of work being stalled by LG since just in the last few months.](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-govt-cites-examples-of-work-being-hampered-8378850/)

And then MCD election time came around and EC delayed the date announcement literal hours before their scheduled press conference on news that Centre is thinking about merging all three MCDs into one. It's like a bad movie script.

Two months later they amended the DMC bill and unified the three corps. It did not solve the funding problem of the MCD, as it did not including getting part of the funding from Centre itself as was expected by even BJP councilors. Every single Municipal body in the country by MCD gets a large part of its funding from Centre.

But not just that, they made it so that MCD is now not accountable to Delhi government in any way but Centre. Rule without any elections or even funding.

After the bill was amended it still took 7 months till election day as Centre took their sweet time redrawing the boundaries of wards and lowering the number from 272 to 250 for seemingly no reason other than delaying and [Gerrymandering](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/mcd-polls-redrawn-ward-boundaries-in-okhla-fuel-allegations-of-politically-motivated-manipulations/article66216001.ece).

In that 7 months they started a torrential downpour of corruption allegations against AAP using EC and CBI. It's funny that the same people taking everything CBI says now as gospel have been making fun of them being used political tools by congress for decades.

And now, In February 2023, a year after BJP's term ended and 3 months after they officially lost the elections. They still control the MCD through a 'special officer' and are about the pass a budget with no input or permission from people that were elected.  They have delayed the mayoral elections 3 times after trying to get Aldermen to vote in the election.

Aldermen are supposed to be non partisan industry experts nominated by Delhi government, the LG now, that give their expertise in Committees of elected councilors. LG elected 10 BJP workers, which includes president of Delhi BJP's Kisan Morcha AND his wife.

Centre is trying to use them as free votes even though it's explicitly unconstitutional. As Supreme court has reiterated. AAP has taken this to court and now MCD polls are on hold until that is done. Next hearing is on Feb 17th.",2023-02-15 19:21:10,"[""Whether to grant full statehood to Delhi or create a new state from existing states like Telangana is relies on basic assumption that both sides of such debate believe in federal structure of India.
