1c63beh,Whose Manifesto do you like better? I have created a word doc that has topic wise side by side comparison. All the points are as they appear in the manifestos. (I haven't changed anything),"**Here is the document :** [**Manifesto Topic Wise Comparison**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yzUa5PXtgJg_mXJxsLH4zFIcA6Ohy5ho/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112103166487411801226&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**About the document**

*Read Time of the entire document : 15 Minutes*

*The document has exact words from both the manifestos without change, and I have included all the points in both the manifestos and classified it topic wise MANUALLY. No ChatGPT or any other AI tools used so that they don't miss any points and hallucinate etc etc.*

*Some points can belong to multiple topics, I have added most points only once in the Document.*

*If you think some points can be better classified into other sections, Please suggest/comment in the document or here.*

*It would be great if any of you can convert this into an interactive website (like streamlit using python) for greater accessibility and good.*

*Please form your opinions only after going through the entire document/manifestos, There are a lot of things proposed by both sides that are astonishing and are less talked about in the social media/media space*

**General first thoughts about both the manifestos:**

1. The first thing that caught my attention was that, Congress' manifesto has neutral English language and neutral section pictures. BJPs manifesto is so much filled with hindi words in English that is so hard to comprehend and you know has name and pictures of Modi everywhere.
2. Congress' Manifesto is overall well balanced and less vague than BJP and gives my heart a positive hope about our shared future. Finally it feels like all the things we rant about on reddit regarding democracy and centralization of power has been addressed. However their manifesto on travel infrastructure (like ports/airports/roads) is short and general. BJPs Manifesto is filled majorly only related to infrastructure points that are vague.. In most points they talk about what they have done in the past and how they will continue the same. 
3. Congress emphasises a lot on the personal human aspect of governance like freedoms and liberties.

**Freebies or Welfare** whatever you call it **:** 

1. **The Myth that congress is a freebie government and something that would bankrupt us is overblown**. 
2. **What if I told you BJP also doles out equal freebies if not more?**   
I was shocked to know that BJP in last 10 years has given out 34 LAKH CRORE ALONE in direct cash transfers to beneficiaries. They have mentioned this in the initial pages if you want to verify.
3. What CONGRESS is probably going to do is unbundle various schemes through which the present govt does cash transfers and then re-bundle them into one scheme ""MahaLakshmi"" and give out 1 Lakh per poor women family.
4. Congress is most likely to do this transfers only after socio-economic survey and my guess is that it would atleast take a year or two along with census. They would try to limit the outflow as much as possible. 
5. Lastly since the amount is fixed at 1L a year , as economy grows this outflow will remain same while collections increase.

**Democracy, Constitutional Bodies and Judiciary:** 

1. **This section is what gives me a positive hope.**
2.  **Division of Supreme Court into 1. Constitutional Court 2. Court of Appeal** 
   1. I think this is to avoid judges to sit on cases of constitutional validity/importance for years like the electoral bonds case since 2019 and the money bill to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny
3. Congress in depth talks about decentralization of power after their experience of having brutally suffered in the last 10 years and the abuse of power. They now know what to fix to strengthen this democracy.
   1. **From Centre to States** : 
      1. They said they would transfer some subjects from concurrent list to state list. Basically making the centre focus more on things like defense (national security), foreign affairs and give more autonomy to states and better tax sharing between centre/states
   2. **Remember Delhi Govt and constant interference from LG (Lt. Governor)?** : Here is what they say
      1.  We will amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 and declare that the Lieutenant Governor shall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of NCT, Delhi on all matters, including Services, except on matters concerning the three reserved subjects. 
   3.  **More Powers to Local City and Rural Bodies (:** 
      1. Taking into account rapid urbanisation, they say that they will amend the laws to grant more executive, financial and administrative powers to the directly-elected Mayor/Chairperson for effective governance in urban local bodies and gram sabhas/panchayats *( a. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996. (b.) The Forest Rights Act, 2006. (c.) The Land Acquisition Act, 2013).* I think this has to do something with taking over of villagers/tribal land for commercial exploitation and deforestation..
      2. Improved Governance of Mayors To improve urban governance, the Mayor/Chairperson will be directly elected for a fixed term of 5 years along with a Council. Executive, financial and administrative powers will be conferred upon the Mayor/Chairperson. The administration will be accountable to the Mayor/Chairperson and the Council. 
      3. I think this has something to do with local cities not holding mayoral elections regularly like BMC/BBMP
      4. A portion of GST revenues will be allocated to panchayats and municipalities 
   4. **More Powers to Sport Bodies :** They also talk about decentralization of power to sport bodies acc to recommendations of the Justice Lodha Committee and Olympic Charter etc to prevent and solve the whole mess around wrestlers.
   5.  **Institutionalize the process of appointing the Chief of Defence Staff  to ensure transparency and military consensus**
   6. **Prevention of Horse Trading , automatic disqualification:**  to amend the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution and make defection  an auto disqualification of the membership in the Assembly or Parliament.
   7. **Law to tally 100% of EVM with VVPAT**
   8. **We promise to strengthen the autonomy of the Election Commission of India (VAGUE)**
   9. **NO To One Nation One Election (A BIG BIG THING FOR DEMOCRACY)** 
   10. **To Improve Transparency in Media and Give more freedoms to Journalists**
      1. **Repeal Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023**
      2. Review and delete controversial clauses that give  unbridled powers of censorship to the government from Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023; Press and Registration of Periodicals Act, 2023, etc.)
      3.  Amend the Press Council of India Act, 1978 to strengthen the system of self regulation, protect journalistic freedoms, uphold editorial independence and guard against government interference against arbitrary search and seizures...
   11. **Pledge to ensure that both Houses of Parliament will convene for 100 days each year, reviving and upholding the esteemed traditions of Parliament.** 
   12. **Additionally, one day per week will be dedicated to discussing the agenda proposed by opposition benches in each House.** 
   13. **We promise to end the arbitrary and indiscriminate suspension of the Internet**
   14. **Review the Telecommunications Act, 2023 and remove the provisions that restrict freedom of speech and expression and that violate the right to privacy.** We promise to review all laws that interfere with the right to privacy and make suitable amendments to various laws to uphold the right to privacy
   15.We promise to enact a law on bail that will incorporate the principle that ‚Äòbail is the rule, jail is the exception‚Äô in all criminal laws.
   16. **Review of all Laws passed without discussion and scrutiny by NDA**
      1. all anti-people laws passed by the BJP/NDA without proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate, especially those relating to workers, farmers, criminal justice, environment & forests and digital data protection, will be thoroughly reviewed and changed. 

Rest of the things I will talk in future posts..

The problem with BJP manifesto is that it is mostly continuation of existing schemes and expansion, rather than new good schemes.  \n  \nCongress has LGBTQ which is quite progressive, and reservation cap is a huge no no. Congress has a few more good policies such as making up to XII classes mandatory, and right to apprenticeship. MNREGA and Asha worker salary increment is also good. Making water harvesting mandatory was also good esp as we have started facing shortages in cities. Reservations is a huge huge no in case of congress.\n\nAll I want is BJP to win, but with no absolute or brute majority or with majority that can be bought.

18oi7gu,Suggest me a low maintenance washing machine,"Although we can afford it, the reason we never had a washing machine is because my mom is tech averse. She's also a clean freak who needs to clean stuff hands on, even when me and dad had been washing our own cloths, the woman still goes around finding random cloth articles to wash. I've tried enticing her multiple times by taking her to showrooms, she rejects at the end moment saying too many buttons, hates not having control over water etc. so I've decided to just force a choice (she'll probably take out cloths from the machine and still wash them by hand). So mitigating risk, I want to buy a simple old school dumb washing machine, especially I'm eying those cheap plasticky models that lie around in boy's hostels. My reasoning is if those machines can survive the onslaught of human shaped animals that live in boy's hostels they can easily last a few centuries in my mom's care. So once she's used to having a washing machine around without feeling like we have committed some kind of great betrayal towards her, I'm planning to throw it out and replace it with a high end ifb or LG.

17dqim2,[Flipkart] How can I recover from loss?,"**Background**

Currently, I stay with my parents in a small town with no closeby TV shops. 

They have been asking me to suggest them a TV but I wanted to make them happy by gifting them one. Reliability was a major factor so was strict with either Sony, Samsung or LG.

**Reason to purchase online**

I had previously purchased Sony 55X80AJ for Rs.71.4k from Amazon in 2021 and had no troubles.

With that experience, On 14th Oct, I purchased Samsung iSmart 55inch TV (cue60) for Rs.39,000 (with no-cost discount its Rs. 37,973). I choose 3-months No-cost EMI.

**On the day of open-box delivery (20th Oct)**

Delivery agent and I saw that there were some scratches on the TV's panel and we weren't sure if it had peel-able plastic screen guard on the panel that you remove after installation.

* Delivery agent also said that it happened to another Samsung 65inch TV and it was returned by the customer.
* I was 70% sure there was a screen guard cause it had a small plastic flap on left side of the TV that is used to help remove screen guard from the screen (just like in phones). For example, please look at the top-right white flap extension ([https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RofAW9BML.\_SL1500\_.jpg](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RofAW9BML._SL1500_.jpg))
* I say 70% surety cause it had other stickers on the screen exactly like this one on both sides of the TV [https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/605448i53DEE990731D995B/strip-exif-metadata/true/image-dimensions/2000?v=v2&px=-1](https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/605448i53DEE990731D995B/strip-exif-metadata/true/image-dimensions/2000?v=v2&px=-1). I wasn't exactly sure if the flap was meant to remove these side stickers.

**Call to Samsung customer care**

* Samsung care couldn't confirm if it had peel-able screen guard. ""Some models have it and some don't"" was their answer.
* My request got denied for Samsung installer/engineers phone number but instead they raised a request for visit during first half of the very next day.

**First call to Flipkart customer care**

Me: I don't want a refund, I want a replacement TV as **my first EMI already started**.

FK: Let me check your return policy sir.

FK: No problem sir, Just ask delivery agent to replace (There is an button to raise replacement on agents phone app).

So, delivery is rejected but a replacement request was raised, TV gets repacked and returned.

&#x200B;

Next day at **2AM** I wake up, I get a notification saying my order was cancelled and refund was initiated. I immediately call Flipkart customer care.

**Second call to Flipkart customer care**

FK: Sorry sir but your order has been cancelled by the seller and nothing can be done now for replacement.

Me: but your colleague confirmed it would be replaced.

FK: Sorry sir, that was a wrong information but nothing can be done now.

Me: ok but what about my EMI's interest payment? 

FK: Sorry sir, we cant do anything.

&#x200B;

**Aftermath**

Processing fee Rs.199/-

ICICI EMI breakdown:

|Month|Principal|Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 (Billed)|12500.86|474.35|
|2|12657.02|318.19|
|3|12815.12|160.08|

I wasn't aware that credit card had **foreclosure fee of 3% (outstanding principal) + advanced EMI interest + GST**. 

Since, I got my refund back today, would bank automatically foreclose this EMI? 

If its not foreclosed automatically, I believe it makes more sense to just pay the interest amount for 3-months and be done with it? 

Does it make sense to raise Consumer complaint to get back my interest payment due to ""**Flipkart's fault**""? 

I say ""Flipkarts fault"" because I was ready to take the TV and go with my gut and risk but Flipkart assured a replacement.

All my conversations with Samsung, Flipkart are recorded.

After this issue, I see many redditors have faced issue with Flipkart. As always I was at correct place but at a wrong time :(",2023-10-22 10:45:24,"['All charges should be auto reversed including the processing charge +GST. EMI will be forclosed without any charge.

We've been using a Sonay Bravia 3D (never used the 3D feature ü•≤) since over a decade and we have had no complaints regarding picture or sound quality. It's just dying at this point and we need a new one. 

Android/Google TVs can slow down over time and the boot time can be horrible. Would LG/Samsung be better with their own OS? What would we be sacrificing?

I'm honestly tempted to buy TCL/Mi/HiSense but I'm not sure about reliability and longevity of these brands.

Not looking at OLED/QLED because they don't make sense for our usecases.

Basically, looking for a comparison between LG, Samsung and Sony as Sony TVs cost around 10-15k more for similar specs. Are they still worth it?

Price-to-performance ratio is also good if you can get a 2 ton 5 star Lloyd AC for below 50K during Amazon sales (currently the model I am referring to i.e. GLS24I5FWGEV is going for 52K minus 1250 if using an HDFC card).

Lloyd for instance claims 6340w as cooling capacity while Panasonic claims 6100w and Carrier claims 6000w . For reference, a 2 ton AC should have a 7000w capacity.

140bzpm,Is LG a good brand to go with for air conditioner? (AC recommendation),"Hi everyone, I have finally decided to get an ac for the first time for a 123 sqft room. It will be used primarily during summer and in monsoon for dehumidification. A 1.5ton 3 star should serve me fine I guess.

My first choice was to go with a Daikin. My neighbour has one 1.5ton 3 star and it has been serving just fine.

But this LG ac caught my eye: https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0BQ3MJ1TG. I don't have a high budget so this seems to be a good deal however I'm curious about LG's service, Many people telling it's good.

So what's your experience has been with LG air conditioners? or should I go with Daikin only? My budget is under 35k, can be stretchable to 37k max.",2023-06-04 12:45:31,"[""I would suggest go with Lg 6 in 1 4star, it has pretty good reviews, the service is amazing, super silent.

Service is also good but parts availability is kind of a crisis right now.\n\nLG is very good. Service is good. Power consumption is ok. Silent. Technically more advanced than all. Note that LG is one of the only brands that have inhouse ac technicians and don't hire third party for servicing. \n\nPanasonic comes in 2nd place. I had an indoor unit leakage issue. But later it was discovered that the installation guys did not fix the water outflow pipe correctly and they identified the problem incorrectly as indoor unit issue. So indoor unit was perfectly fine. All in all panasonic is pretty nice. But costlier than Daikin. If you want your room to get ice cold really fast, panasonic is the way to go. It's very powerful. \n\nVoltas, well what can I say. Worst installation, worst service, and quality is not good. \n\n\nWhich ac to buy? Whatever you have an offer on from the first 3 and check if service is available in your locality. \n\n\nYou can also consider Samsung.

13mz9fg,Delhi Govt v. LG | Centre's Reasons For Review Of Supreme Court's Judgment,,2023-05-20 16:21:48,"[""Center needs to keep the f*ck out of states/UT's affairs & manage their own deliverables""]"
13mhjjr,The nuance behind the GNCTD Ordinance,"Feel free to correct me on this, but I do think that the outrage at the GNCTD Ordinance promulgated on May 19 overlooks an important nuance. But well, it's an outrage - can't expect anything more. 

Article 239AA(4) reads as follows:

""(4) There shall be a Council of Ministers consisting of not more than ten per cent. of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly, with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of his functions in relation to matters with respect to which the Legislative Assembly has power to make laws, *except in so far as he is, by or under any law, required to act in his discretion*""

Note the highlighted part and keep it in your mind for now.

The dispute was on whether the LG has power over services, or is he *bound* by the aid and advice of the CM and CoM. 

When the dispute was before the SC, the GNCTD Act did not specifically provide on the matter of services. Hence, the court was called upon to interpret the GNCTD Act (*as it stood then*) and the Constitution. It used the principles of representative democracy and federalism to hold that the Delhi Government (and Legislative Assembly) should have control over services. 

Sure, what the Union Government (through the President) has done is against the spirit of the SC judgment, but legally speaking, it seems to be in order. Why? Because the Parliament _is_ authorised to make and amend the GNCTD Act.

Now the Supreme Court will be required to examine whether the _Constitutional provision Article 239AA(4)_ is in line with the basic structure of the Constitution. And that, I'm sure, would be an interesting constitutional query.

Disclaimer: for the record, ideologically I'm not in support of the Ordinance. But legally, I don't see anything wrong with it.",2023-05-20 04:12:45,"['* Your post title should be an accurate summary of your text post.

1. No brand has their own technicians. Every brand outsource them. However, LG is known to have the best and fastest support and I personally experienced it.
2. General and Mitsubishi (heavy duty) makes the best and most reputed ACs in India. However, they are just as much expensive and the service might not be the best. But best believe you won't need to use their services for years because their AC would rarely go bad.
3. Daikin is another brand that's slightly cheaper than the above two brands and makes just as good ACs. However, as of now, they don't make convertible ACs. Also some of their cheap ACs are really bad and must be avoided. Daikin is also the brand that only makes ACs so you best believe they are the best at what they do.
4. Fun Fact - All three brands stated above are Japanese.
5. Carrier is another brand that makes really good ACs but you might not find their support services in smaller cities. They also offers you 5 years warranty on everything and 10 years on compressor.
6. Most brands offer you 1 year warranty, 4-5 year on PCB, and 9-10 years on compressor. That's also the bare minimum you should look for. Also, every brand WILL fix your AC but since the technician has to come from another city, there might be delay in getting your AC fixed with brands like carrier and general.
7. LG ACs don't have the highest cooling capacity but they do have the least electricity consumption as well as noise levels. Also LG offers fastest service if something goes wrong. Point to remember - your experience completely depend on the technician as every brand outsource them.
8. IFB is an Indian brand that also makes pretty good ACs at quite a cheap rate. I was getting a 2022 model 1.5 ton 5 star ac for just 36k with free installation. They also offer 5 year warranty like Carrier but their is considerable worse as it doesn't include free gas and free labor. They just don't have a USP. They do have a fairly fast after sales service.
9. Godrej's AC are the cheapest if that's what you are looking for. No idea about their durability or after sales service though.
10. Samsung ACs are decent as well. They do only offer 1 year warranty on PCB instead of 5 years. However, they do have two USPs (Unique Selling Points) - One is their Wifi which is the best because they are a smartphone brand and knows how to integrate and use wifi to it's best. Their Wi-Fi app (smart things) is also the best amongst every AC brand. Their second USP is their WindFree series, which is really good for people who can't tolerate ACs in general.
11. Hitachi - No idea. They are seem to pretty acknowledged amongst people. However, they also do not make convertible ACs
12. Lloyd - I didn't have a good time with them in the past. They only work well as long as they are in the warranty. After one year, the coils started freezing. After 5 years - the compressor started malfunctioning. Also my uncle's AC started leaking water after 1 year which also killed the TV underneath.
13. Haier - Never used their products, Never seen anyone use their products. They do offer you triple inverter ACs with all the goodness to the max like 6000 cooling capacity, triple inverter etc but every person I asked except the dealer himself said that Haier is a chinese brand doesn't make durable ACs. So I won't suggest them.
14. Panasonic - Almost forgot about them. Another Japanese brand. Not the best brand value but makes ACs on par with LG. Also are the second best in Wi-Fi AC after Samsung. I heard their ACs have gotten a lot better this year.",2023-05-15 16:14:16,"['* Your post title should be an accurate summary of your text post.

13i6s3m,My Rant about LG and their *own technicians*,"Just bought my AC today. And I had to file a complaint today only. And don't get me wrong, I hate to be that ""I would like to talk to your manager"" karen type of guy. But the situation was worse than I expected. I bought LG primarily because they are just supposed to provide the best service. With that, let's see what happened -

1. They don't have their own trained technicians with uniforms like you would expect. They also outsource local technicians.

2. They don't do clean installation. I don't know if this is a thing in big cities only, but in mine they certainly did a horrible job.

3. They are rude and try to gaslight you. Mine asked me for the satisfaction code company provides us, and when I confronted him by asking him to do the installation first, he said ""Do you consider us theives"". I still held back and gave them the code that time. Ironically, they ran away like thieves after doing the bare minimum. Didn't install my stabilizer and mcb after the confrontation. Take a look at the photos, do you expect me to turn on the AC with a hanging wire?

https://preview.redd.it/hw7yebiumzza1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bee9ec64c413e3f61a6b3b2b245199b8a97b653c

Unfortunately, they messed with the wrong guy and I reported them to LG. LG did send a new technician right away who did a fantastic job, so I have to give LG credit for that. The new guy also installed stand for the AC.

https://preview.redd.it/s8t0joj8nzza1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e0dc92f83222b7807da0f7ec7a9c4c86b9da8a7

All I want to say is no brand has exceptionally good service, everybody outsource their technicians and it's just a matter of luck what type of technician you get. But you can do two things, don't give them the satisfaction code unless your work is done no matter what. And report them to the company if you have any complaints.",2023-05-15 12:25:59,"['* Your post title should be an accurate summary of your text post.

Product's well designed and tends to last.\n\nFor anyone still following this - a little bit of background on Carrier's position in India. I was in the same spot few years ago and am now invested with Carrier ACs, have 2 of them running in my home(one's \\~4 years old) - just for context.\n\nCarrier used to a be a premium-ish brand 10 years back and had good retail presence in India, but Korean and Japanese appliances giants ate them up in the last 5-6 years leading them to downsize their marketing significantly.\n\nThey still exist in India in the form of a JV with Midea, a Chinese appliances major, and Carrier Midea jointly manufactures both Carrier and Midea ACs. They also do contract manufacturing for other brands. Not sure about Midea, but Carrier ACs are mostly sold through contracts to B2B clients in bulk - Government offices, Banks, Private commercial spaces, etc. You'll spot a bunch of them in these places, and Carrier refrigerators/chillers are quite popular in supermarkets as well.\n\nCarrier's service network isn't their own - they've appointed 3rd parties at district level to service the demand. So depending on where you are, your experience with Carrier service will vary, unlike bigger brands like LG, who thrive in the service aspect.\n\nOn the product side of things, I've seen Carrier ACs getting cheaper online(which is what drew me to them) and their SEER ratings are up there with the bigger brands, which means they're built to operate just as efficiently. They're also built to be maintainable - this is coming from my experience cleaning an LG AC at my parents' place vs. the Carrier ACs I have at my home. Possibly has to do with the fact that these are designed for commercial use, and need to be serviced easily.\n\nMy older AC is installed in my home office, and runs for \\~20 hours a day(almost throughout the year apart from winters) with very reasonable energy consumption, and has had no parts replaced/ hasn't required gas refill so far, which is why I ended up getting the 2nd one from Carrier as well. Service costs are similar with what you see with other brands, it costs about Rs. 800 for a routine service.\n\nOn the service experience side, personally I've had no major issues. The 2nd AC took a little longer than expected to be installed by the service partner - I got both ACs from Amazon, the first one was installed on the 2nd day after delivery, the recent AC I got took almost a week to get installed(installation was on the cheaper side - cost Rs. 2300 with the stand for ODU). But I've had no issues post installation, it works perfectly, just like my older AC. If I book a routine service today, I'll have my AC serviced tomorrow, and everything else is like clockwork.\n\nMy Opinion -\n\nIf you're on a budget - definitely get Carrier, possibly the best product for the price, if you can live with potentially sub-par service. You do have the option of getting Urban Company service(costs just as much) post the free service expiry, depending on how your experience with your area's service partner is during the free period.\n\nIf your budget's flexible, I'd actually recommend Mitsubishi over LG - I've had a friend install it, and it cools really quick and is fairly maintenance friendly. Pre-owned/2nd hand AC market mostly has demand for Mitsubishi units, I think for a good reason."", ""Late to reply but I would suggest Carrier I've been using one for more than 7 years now I only had to call in a technician once I just clean the filters once in 2-3 months that's it! one of the best AC's I've used so far"", 'Following', 'Carrier is a great option with 5 year warranty & all.  \nI have an Carrier AC at my home is working fine & great no problems from 3 years running smooth.', 'Hello, regarding Carrier AC.

13g9lh4,Need help buying 2 ACs,"I am buying two ACs - 
1. 1.5 Ton 5 star Inverter Convertible (hopefully with WiFi) - Budget = 45K
2. 1 Ton 3 star Inverter Convertible (The cheapest I can get) - Budget = 30k

Now the issue is, there are a lot of brands in the market and it's hard to just go off specifications. Here is what I know so far - 

1. LG's ACs are considered underrated. Their cooling capacity is slightly low compared to others but their efficiency and noise levels are the best. Also, only LG has trained technicians unlike other brands like LLoyd that hire any local technician and these lack knowledge.
2. General ACs are good but expensive. Daikin ACs are also good but aren't convertible. Also the after sales service on both of these is arguable (not better than LG)
3. I don't wanna buy Lloyd due to bad past experience.
4. Haier and IFB are providing me ACs with everything I require plus 5 year comprehensive warranty and 10 year compressor warranty. I know nothing about the brands and their product quality though.

1072tj7,Going back to the old ways of listening to songs,"What‚Äôs the best tiny mp3 player out there with support for external SD card. Have used YT Premium, Spotify and Prime Music. They all have one problem. They delete songs from playlists without ever notifying because of rights and issues. 

Would‚Äôve bought iPod right away if it was still available. What‚Äôs the next best thing? I see Sony Walkman on Amazon but it doesn‚Äôt support ext SD card.

Some back story (unrelated but might be relatable):

I got into music at 8. Would record songs on radio using a tape recorder. Used to hoard a bunch of cassettes. Then came the digital era and started maintaining one SD card. Used it with LG feature phone that had good music support. It lasted about 6 years. Still have that SD card and the memories. 

I‚Äôd organise music in folders by seasons or the class I was in. Like Summer 2010 or 4th-5th standard or Final long vacation before college. Feels so good to instantly go back in time. 

Then bought the first iPhone and started using Apple Music due to lack of SD card support. Also, didn‚Äôt like carrying two phones. They intentionally make it difficult to play local storage music so that people use their streaming services. Other streaming services had their own issues. And the hassle of organising everything again. 

Anyway, this continued, kept switching between services. When you‚Äôre not satisfied even alter paying for it, it‚Äôs time to find something better. One day I found that YT deleted all the songs from a very old playlist. That‚Äôs when I decided it‚Äôs time.

wq6ul9,[URGENT] Need your suggestion for a 2 Ton Split Inverter AC 2022,"Hello everyone,

I live in Kolkata. I am currently using a 2 ton Panasonic Inverter AC I bought back in 2016 (When Inverter tech was quite new).

I have been mostly happy with my AC as it usually cooled at 24. But due to the very thinly spaced evaporator fins, it accumulated a lot of dust and grime even though it helped in better cooling. Due to this my AC had to be cleaned vigorously twice or thrice a year, as my house is on the main road. Many unqualifed quacks tried multiple things and this resulted in weakening of the fins (which I suspect is made of aluminium). They have become bent and is not taking up hot air from the room, resulting in blockage, even though its coeaned mutltiple times. I also believe that the repeated indiscriminate use of the current jet cleaning also compounded the bent fin problem.

Now my AC indoor unit coil is freezing up due to this artificial blockage caused by bent fins. 

I now immediately have to buy a new split inverter AC as I work from home and the weather in Kolkata is hot and humid. I use it 3-4 hours in the afternoon and 10 hours at night. My room is ~250 sq ft with east facing walls and at 1st Floor.

So here are my requirements:

1) 2 Ton Split Inverter AC
2) Well spaced and strong fins which can resist jet servicing (Panasonic has the narrowest spacing based on my conversations with multiple technicians, so Panasonic is off my list)
3) Good long-term cooling 
4) Auto SWING (both horizontal and vertical)
5) Good Energy Efficiency (Min 3 Star)
6) Good after sales service.

Very few companies focus on the 2 Ton segment.

I had narrowed down to two companies: LG and Carrier.

LG: Dual inverter, Ocean Black Fin, Good after sale service

Carrier: Very good cooling (based on online reviews), Ebergy efficient, after sales dicy, NO auto horizontal swing.

Can you please suggest me the best 2 Ton AC aming these two with the specific model number considering my requirements? Am also open to suggestions from other conpanies if they match my needs.

If you know any Carrier ACs current models which have both horizontal and vertical AUTO swing, do let me know.

wgprtd,Seeking suggestion for an Inverter AC,"Want to buy an Inverter AC for a room size about 145sq ft. Can't decide which one to choose. Visited many stores but each throws up a new spice into the cauldron. 

Few points in my mind :
- Living in a rented space so room size may change in future : 1.5 Ton would be right

- It is going to get hotter year after year : Should get inverter AC will save in the long run

- BEE ratings have changed WEF July 22 : 5 star ACs manufacturered this year are 4 star now

- The next batch of ACs that would be manufactured will be significantly costlier while saving a little more power : Should buy one of the existing models while they are in stock

I have had some good experience with Voltas but they don't provide any additional warranty on the PCB like LG & Panasonic. From what I've read, LG has a premium value & its ACs provide lesser cooling for the same tonnage as other brands.

td8xm5,PSA: Stay away from LG TVs,"LG TVs (especially the budget 4k TVs) are a shitshow. What's the most important part about a tv? The panel - but with these TVs you literally don't know what panel you're going to get till the tv gets delivered.    
  
For the exact same model you will get either get an IPS panel (good display, good viewing angles) or a VA panel (shit viewing angles). Their website doesn't mention the panel you're going to get, when you ask their support they'll tell you ""You'll get a true 4k panel"" - a completely meaningless statement.
    
To put it into perspective imagine buying a laptop and not knowing what cpu you're going to get till the time it's delivered. Is it an i3, an i5? Who knows ? It's a lucky draw and you'll find out when it gets delivered.  
    
I'm not sure how this is even legal. How can the exact same model have different specifications? I'm completely steering away from LG for the coming few years. Any company following such shady practices deserves to be boycotted. I would rather pay 20-25% more but get a reliable product.

Even in the more expensive mid to upper end models, you can get a panel from different manufacturers and with different technologies  What you get entirely depends on your luck. This is why I advise against Samsung TV's\n\nThere is nothing illegal about it though. It would be illegal if manufacturer explicitly list IPS Panel in the specs and then gives you a different panel. As long as they don't list anything explicitly or have contradictory specs, they can use any panel.\n\nIf you want to ensure you get a IPS Panel in your TV, you have to buy a model that explicitly mentions it. All the LG TV's I have bought explicitly mention IPS Panel and have the IPS logo on the box. If they are not mentioning Panel type explicitly, then it can have any panel type. And they are probably doing this for the budget models.\n\nSo, check if the panel type is listed or the IPS logo is present on the box of your TV.

For example, do you know if every laptop unit with the same model  number has the SSD or RAM of same make? Heck, the chips used in the RAM DIMM's can vary even for the same brand  and model of RAM. Manufacturers can also have multiple sources for logic board or any other component. In fact, even for the main CPU, the performance characteristics of the same chip from different batches of manufacturing can vary. That's why we have things like component binning or guides on component batches and what not for PC enthusiasts who care about them.\n\nI bought a specific brand and model of RAM for my PC because I was guaranteed to get specific make of chips with high overclocking potential. There were a dozen other models of the same brand with the same specs, but using different chips.

tcfthe,"For the love of god, PLEASE don't buy a Xiaomi TV if you live in India","I had an Mi TV 4 Pro 55"" that I bought in the end of 2018 for about 50k. It had crappy speakers so a soundbar costed about 5k on top of that.

 That TV died last year. Its panel went rogue just a couple of months after the completion of its warranty. It's unrepairable. Xiaomi is quoting me 40k to put in a new panel, I've already spent 12k in aftermarket repairs so there's no way this is viable.

After its death, I've been wandering around on online forums trying to find how could a TV die so soon. You see, appliances like TV, fridge, washing machine etc are bought by Indian consumers with a long term outlook, generally 8+ years. Heck, my older CRT TVs are still alive and functioning!

I found that panels going dead is an incredibly common sight with Xiaomi TVs. They use cheap components and even though these panels are manufactured by LG/Samsung, they're the absolute worst in the category that you can find.

The only reason I'm writing this is to warn folks out there. Since these are the cheapest Android TVs that come in the range, most people are tempted to get those. 

The reviews you see on Flipkart or Amazon are all recent reviews. Reviews that people leave right after buying the TV and maybe using it for some days.

It's impossible to put good speakers in a TV and still price it competitively. No matter what the TV advertises, sound will be crappy.

rjqtos,Am I being judgemental or homophobic here? Should I not get annoyed like this?,"So guys this happened today, I went to a salon in Pune where I stay not the big expensive one but a small one with only barbers. Just when I went in two other guys also came (normal decent looking guys aged 22-25, born and raised in Mumbai).

They were constantly chatting something a bit loudly everyone was able to hear their conversation (in Hindi). Now from their conversation, one can deduce they were gay or into men. Now I want to tell it here itself I am not homophobic and I consider myself pro LQBTQ+, but these people annoyed me.

First of all, they were acting/talking in the typical way that Hindi movies portray gay people, like the tone of their voice, saying ""OMG"", ""Of course"", ""naughty"", tbh not annoying can be someone's way of talking. Then they were swiping through each other's tinder profiles and then objectifying the men that we there paired with while one was sitting on a salon chair and the other was on the sofa right behind. Showing the semi-naked picture of men to almost everybody there. 

Next, then uncle who was working on that guy's hair was quite old so he was finding it difficult to work according to his needs, so the guy was like ""Uncle, aap to mera pura BDSM kr de rhe ho.."", uncle understood none of it. Then the other guy (the guy on the sofa) commented on looks ""tera baal to acha lg rha, but shakal buri lag rhi.."", the main guy said ""Fuck you..."" and other guys said ""Wo to tera kaam hai na..."" and both chuckled, And this kind of talk was going on and on.

Then I was taking a head massage, the barber was doing his stuff which made clapping sound (normal, yif you know how they do it). Both guys again looked at each other smirked and laughed, because again they thought of that sound in a sexual way.

So my question now is, Am I being judgemental or homophobic here? Should I not get annoyed like this? 

My thought was you can be gay/straight or anything, but you don't talk sexual things in public places like these I think I would be equally annoyed if some straight couple was doing something like this here. And again we blame Hindi movies for portraying people of LGBTQ+ in a wrong way, but then again was it wrong though? 

If I am wrong here please don't hate me educate me.",2021-12-19 06:32:12,"['It would be annoying even if heterosexual people talked like that in public .\n\n>""Uncle, aap to mera pura BDSM kr de rhe ho.."",\n\nI mean who talks like that in public , I would be annoyed AF.', ""Doesnt sound like their sexuality is actually relevant.

r18ptz,Need advice in choosing a monitor for my Desktop.,"Hello guys, I'm in need of buying a new monitor and have been doing some research about it. My budget is around 12-15k INR max and have found some models in the price range. So please help me on this matter. 

My primary usage is office work (word, excel wnd some proprietary softwares and web based applications) and watching movies/tv series. I also enjoy editing videos as a hobby. I don't play high end games. So I don't prioritise millisecond response or high refresh rate. The things that I primarily look for are:

- decent balance between colour and contrast
- full HD (1920 x 1080)
- 21.5 - 24 inch screen size as 27 would be too big for 1080p
- backlight bleeding as minimum as possible if not totally avoidable.
- Good customer service.

Although I prefer VA over IPS for the contrast, IPS has it's advantages. Also it is hard to find a good VA monitor with similar features. Brandwise I prefer Samsung or LG as I heard they are better in customer service. Also I had an LG 15.6 inch HD monitor for over 8 years without any problem. These are the models I have come across that I feel good enough.

A sine wave basically is a projection of the trigonometric ""sine"" function and looks something like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jil9o0sn7dxc1.png?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa1ba4334eac16c530484606e23a4f672f54c845\n\nThis pattern is followed by a lot of things and is used to explain things across domains.\n\nFor this particular case, the AC supply that you recieve at home follows a sine wave pattern (ideally). Inverters, particularly the older models, the waveform isn\'t usually as smooth and may be something like these:\n\n[Waveform](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcThJUZGR_iyUPXp__WvXuiafqvOIU6jC6e0PoAazgdlhWphnauZVGfSPF0&s=10)\n\nSo, while your devices are designed for a sine wave, if your inverter isn\'t able to generate a pure sine wave, you\'ll notice interference.

onypf9,What options should I look at when buying a 50 inch 4K today?,"Our budget is 50,000 rupees. We've decided on a 49/50 inch TV as that's the biggest that will comfortably fit in our space. I want to easily be able to put shows from OTT platforms.

oncgo6,Has anyone here had a 2017 Macbook Air suddenly die in 12-18 months?,"I believe that a good number of mid-2017 Macbook Airs (A1466) sold in India have a fatal manufacturing flaw in the logic board that usually leaves them dead in weeks or months after the warranty period ends.

I'm posting this thread to document it so when it happens again, the next victim can find supporting evidence.

I'm typing this on a mid-2013 Macbook Air still running flawlessly. I couldn't say enough good things about it. I'd recommended a family friend to buy one around Christmas 2019. It was dead by March 2021.

Then I went around searching Amazon.in and Flipkart reviews to see if this was an isolated event, maybe plain bad luck, because the model has been sold, unchanged for the most part, for years.

(The latest revision was in 2017. It was usually sold for Rs. 55k-60k just before the pandemic, even though it was discontinued in developed countries.)

It is not isolated. I found a pattern of reviews online describing the same ordeal. [Here's an **album of 90 reviews**](https://imgur.com/a/UP855u8) across [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/apple-macbook-air-core-i5-5th-gen-8-gb-128-gb-ssd-mac-os-sierra-mqd32hn-a/product-reviews/itm0602f520428ca?pid=COMEVCPQBXBDFJ8C&lid=LSTCOMEVCPQBXBDFJ8C5XWYJP&aid=overall&certifiedBuyer=false&sortOrder=NEGATIVE_FIRST) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-MQD32HN/product-reviews/B073Q5R6VR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&filterByKeyword=logic&sortBy=recent&filterByStar=critical) detailing the same motherboard/logic board issue of the 8GB 2017 Macbook Air dying after 12-18-24 months and being quoted Rs. 40k for a board replacement.

My friend got a L4 [chip-level repair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UBy7L3YzLg) attempted by Fixxo in Bangalore. They are one of the rare shops that advertise that kind of repair. They gave up and my friend got a replacement board from them for Rs. 35k (because WFH), which is also giving issues! They are getting it looked into.

The reviews statistically make up only .02% of the total reviews on both sites (including others where the logic board failed under warranty). This is important, because dissatisfied buyers will take the effort to post a negative review and are expected to be overrepresented. It's nevertheless painful and frustrating to read those reports.

I will still recommend the newer M1 Macbooks to anyone who can afford it, but I want to know if anyone from this subreddit also had a Macbook Air from that 2017 model era that met the same fate.

*Edit: Added more screenshots from Apple forum members (mostly Indians), consumer complaint forum posts and one Paytmmall review.

Edit 2: Fixxo has inspected the board and found ""corrosion."" The 45-day warranty period is over, but they'll replace it for free as a gesture of goodwill.

Hmmm. They did make off like bandits on the initial trade, selling a replacement board at market price and then keeping the old one to harvest parts off of.

Amazon is offering Rs. 16k for a used Macbook Air if it turns on. Time to offload it and cut your losses.

og49lh,Dishwasher Buying Mini Guide,"I have noticed a lot of people are buying Dishwashers nowadays. I too bought one a month back and I feel the stuff I learnt could help you guys buy a good one.

#**The Brand and Service**

There are a lot of brands, namely, Siemens, Boschs, LG, IFB, FABER, VOLTAS, etc. 

If you're buying I would recommend doing some research and checking out how is the service of that brand. 

But by all means avoid IFB. They were a good brand but now they outsource their services to third parties. And due to pandemic you'll have some random kids coming at your place who have zero interest in working and probably 12th pass.

* Siemens and Bosch are amazing but their service is lacking in some areas.
* LG is the most dominant one with features, service and price
* Faber is good but the service is less in many areas
* Voltas is pretty good. If you have two people and probably a kid. Have less space then Voltas is best for you.

#**Detergent**

You need three things, a salt, a rinse aid, and autodish. Finish is the best tbf and the ones made by IFB as well. You can get tablets as well if you're gonna load your machine 70% everytime. Tablets are actually pretty good and cheap, if you calculate it will come down to ‚Çπ12-15 per tablet from finish.

If you have detergent, you'll have a small measurement line, add the detergent accordingly. The salt needs to be added in the machine with water.  These three last almost 30 washes.

#**Service Guy selling stuff**

The guys who come for demo will often sell you three things, water softerners, stands and covers (and detergents but we discussed that).

* Buy the Water softerners if you live in area with hard water. Otherwise with the salt you should be fine. There are also testers inside the pack to check your water hardness, if the guy is hellbent on selling you the water softerners, ask him to do a test or take photo of the softeners and buy it online.

* NANI STANDO? I have two dishwashers bought at the same time. A Voltas Beko and LG. The stand which some serve guys sell are pretty strong but lack height. I needed some height to clean it from down below so I got one online for ‚Çπ1500 which had 8Inch height. Usually no stand is made from the company. However the pro of getting it from service Guy is that he installs it for you. If you get a stand beforehand from online stores then you can ask him to install it as well.

* Covers. Few companies make it themselves but otherwise it's upon you. Get it from the guy or get it online. All servicing people will take some extra money for themselves and it makes sense. If you want to pay them, get it. If you want the design they have, get it. If you want cheap or different design, go online.


#**The Functions** 

Usually all machines have similar stuff. Bosch had a feature, if there's a power cut, it will resume the function. But no other machine does that. If you live in areas with regular power cuts then get Bosch. 

Otherwise, all machines have regular or auto function, delicate function for glass and delicate vessels, turbo or intensive ones for intensive washes.

There are additional functions like extra steam, wash, or half loads. 

#**Installation**

Sadly the installation needs to be done on your own. If your vendors are good you'll probably get a plumber who knows how dishwashers work and do it for you, otherwise nope.

You need an inlet and an outlet, similar to Washing Machine but it's a bit different. 

#**Verdict**

I had a bit of roundabout. Over two months back I got IFB from a Mall. And the demo, installation, the servicing guys.. it was chaotic. The machine itself did not feel worth the buck. And they took a lot of time and were trying to convince us to use it but we were hellbent.

After a lot of trouble we got the LG. And today we finally got it running. The machine and the servicing feels premium and the money feels well spent. I specifically bought it for the service which Amazon Reviews say is lacking in Bosch for some regions. However it's all upon you. In some areas, you'll receive a better stock, or better service, or better demo. Due to the pandemic they're running out of stock every now and then, so please check your product properly.",2021-07-08 10:11:21,"['Couple of questions:\n\nWhat is your opinion on the cleaning itself?

Saving it for later.', ""He's covered it all, I'd just like to add that if you don't have a maid, a dishwasher is really a quality if life upgrade. I don't live in India now, and obviously the financial decision is different, but where I am, a budget dishwasher is cheaper than a maid's salary.\n\nAnd getting clean fresh utensils, which I find are cleaned much better than by hand, feels very nice. The thing saves water too, so that's also nice."", 'thank you for authoring this guide. some of the tips are very helpful', ""I've got one last year from Bosch. The Bosch ones are pretty good and Voltas Beko too. Siemens models are same as Bosch but priced a bit higher  LG also is great is what I heard and has some unique features and is a bit costlier. Almost all brands have hiked the rates since last year. Bosch and Voltas Beko are made in Turkey if I'm not wrong.\n Bosch has stopped selling the 12 place settings model and started selling 13 place setting model now. \n\nI've been using Fortune branded detergent powder, salt and rinse aid. This has been the most reasonably priced detergent I felt which does its job neatly and hasn't disappointed me. Finish is the most renowned but those products are costlier and same is the case with Crystal brand which is reputed but almost 2-2.5 times pricier than fortune. Other brands have also started selling now like Vim but I haven't tried them yet. Detergent is available in tablets or powder form, I prefer powder as it gives flexibility to add as much as needed. Rinse aid is needed for dry and shine of the utensils and salt to maintain the hardness levels based on the inlet water.  Both settings can be tweaked and even be disabled. It's been pretty good experience overall as it helps clean in several modes depending on the need. Bosch extended warranty offers are also pretty reasonable\n\nEdit -- more info : when I purchased it last year there were only very few models available and Voltas and LG weren't in stock and had to buy 12 place setting from Bosch. I would recommend 13 or 14 place settings model as there would be additional provision for cutlery tray. \n\nFeel free to ask anything, I will try to provide information as much I know."", 'Where is everyone installing theirs?

With dishwasher things get cleaned more better. You can see a brand new shine and sense that ""okay this feels new after cleaning"". \n\nIt certainly doesn\'t compare to hand wash, where you can get every nook and cranny. If you wash something like a vessel in which you made tea, you can see some of the stains as is, which are stuck and only can be removed with hand wash. But there are other areas which you will ignore on normal wash.\n\nYou can say it cleans 75-85% on an average. You need to often rinse things before you take them in the machine. But what comes out feels brand new. \n\n* There are different modes. Prewash type modes have a normal water rinse of 15 minutes. While other mods are from 1.30hr to 3.30hr.

But make sure you have regular water supply.', 'In terms of cleaning a lot can depend on the machine itself. I feel most of the machines are usually powerful enough to clean it completely. \nBut there are few more important stuff that can affect the clean quality:\n\n1.\tHow stacked the utensils are: The more tightly stacked, the harder for the machine to get it cleaned. Try not to overload it. Giving space to each dish/utensil is vital for the water to reach in the tougher spots. \n2.\tthe detergent itself: I have used finish and cascade and each of those brands have varying ‚Äúlevels‚Äù. For finish its quantum ultimate and for cascade its platinum version. The levels definitely make a huge difference in my experience. I myself prefer cascade platinum. \n3.\tthe rinse aid can also make a difference\n\nFor 90% of the dishes I dont pre wash AT ALL. This includes rice cookers, utensils where I have cooked dal etc. For hard/sticky stuff like cheese, indo-chinese (corn flour slurry), baked/burnt food etc a quick pre-wash by hand is good enough.\n\n\nI used to be completely against dishwasher. Used to think its just a machine for the lazy, etc. But now I cannot live without them.

How will you rate performance of dishwasher against kadai, tawa etc?', ""Good question. I had space besides between my refrigerator and sink. Which is where I installed it. Our homes aren't exactly made for this but yeah, had to manage"", ""* Mostly everything is done in warm water. The machine is often hot and can go up to 60-80 degrees to give a proper wash to these utensils.\n\n* For something like prewash which doesn't have steam or detergent, the function runs for 15 mins and you're done. But otherwise, after the function is done you have to wait for 10-15 mins, and open the lid and let the steam go out for 10-15 mins. And you should be done.\n\n* They say don't put aluminium but I have put it and it came out shiny xD. Usually you'll receive a small list of what not to put xD. Don't put especially delicate items. I have had glassware, biryani utensil, cooker, chai vessel, the stone thing to grind masalas, steel bottles, plastic bottles."", 'For the 3rd one: be careful of delicate/thin non-dishwasher friendly glass.

I have had varying results with nutella jars. \nI have also had varying results with wooden items like chakla (utensil to make rotis).

Constant dishwashing will blunt them!', ""Salt reduces water hardness, if your water supply is not hard water you dont need this.\n\nRinse aid reduces surface tension of the water, so at the end of a wash the water 'slides' off vessels so there are no water drop stains.

Played along, said give me first prize. She gave an Amazon listing code and said to type that into search bar of Amazon. Code was b08mb4pxcw, which brought up Dell Inspiron 3501 15.6 inch laptop.

Then add to Cart any item of price 5k or above. And then ask me to confirm what item I have added, and its price. She already had my postal address (how?) but no access to my Amazon account. üòê

o21wrz,Suggestions for Water Purifier for high TDS (~700) & somewhat hard/salty water.,"I'm looking for Water Purifier for home use on a budget providing good value for money.

Purification Technology: RO might be the main thing to look for imo, but I'm open for better informed suggestions.

Budget: About 7K to 10K (max 15K) Upfront Cost

AMC: This is the part that sucks imo, but I'm ready to spend for this (target : 3.5k a year sounds reasonable) but ideally I'll try to maximize this and I don't wanna go through stupid and irresponsible after sales stuff. Ideally would like to go for someone that can be serviced even outside of company service reliably.

Storage Capacity: I think it's pointless and we're a family of 4 adults and I can always switch on the Purifier twice a day.

Water Pressure: I have good water pressure but again this is my subjective opinion.

Existing Water Quality: The Water is generally clean & clear with no visible impurities or odour. It just tastes a bit salty and has high TDS.

Some additional backstory: We've recently shifted from Mumbai where we had soft water to Pune. There we had a UV Water Purifier (Aquaguard Crystal Plus) but unfortunately this might be useless at our current location. I'll mostly keep the old one aside for now as it is in prime condition or might let some close relative with soft water have it.

Main Concerns: Reading reviews on Amazon and Flipkart almost all the models seem to have mixed reviews from extremely bad to good experiences. The ratings are high but the reviews are generally negative. I feel like the ratings maybe artificially inflated. Hence, I'm reaching out to redditors. Mainly, I don't wanna deal with shitty after sales tactics. If necessary I'll buy stuff but I don't wanna be constantly pestered by the company reps or so for something I don't really need.

What I'm looking forward to:
I'm looking for your experiences with any of the popular brands/companies. To name a few - Eureka Forbes/Aquaguard, Kent, HUL PureIt, Blue Star, Faber, LG, Whirlpool, feel free to suggest any other brand if you had a good hassle-free experience with them.
Suggestions for any particular brands or models would be helpful.

nbdf6i,A despairing state of affairs,"Today I went to our family doctor for non-covid related consultation with my father. I asked the doctor about the gap between two vaccine doses (it's now increased to 12 to 16 weeks as per govt norms). He had told me earlier that 10 to 12 weeks gap is proving quite effective. But this new instructions, he said, was due to shortages of vaccines and 'it's all politics by opposition!'

I was stunned.

This is a doctor we have been going to for about a decade. I thought he was very scientific minded. He has even gotten angry with ayurvedic doctors in front of me. His point was that if ayurveda works then let the knowledge out and have it produce on mass scale so everybody benefits. Let there be trials. But no. These Vaidyas just keep the knowledge in the family and nobody else can follow up with that treatment. I was quite happy when he ranted.

Now, he is telling me that central gov had a proper plan of vaccination, but 'it was the states who started clamoring for 18 to 44 age group vaccination and hence there's a shortage now'. All the blame to the opposition for botching up vaccination. ""All of them are saying that let the vaccine be manufactured by others. Do they think making vaccine is that easy?! India, Brazil, South Africa (and one more country I don't remember) are the only ones producing vaccines on mass scale. How can they say that?! AAP and all those people are just saying that for vote bank. You only want to blame center. But when it comes to credit, you don't give them any!""

Frankly I am still in shock. Because being a non-medical person, I cant refute it without at least reading up a bit. And honestly, I don't even know whether he is right or wrong. He refused to believe me that center placed the order of vaccines on 28th April 2021. ""No it was placed much earlier. Delhi govt just completely botched the job."" Delhi govt could definitely have done better, but I am still wary because of whole tussle between Delhi and LG+Center.

I realized one thing though. Bhakts are bhakts not because they're intentionally/unintentionally malicious (which they are anyway). It's that they actually believe that *they have the correct data and THEIR interpretation is the correct one.* And that's why there's no 'opening their eyes' with them.

He can swing the emotions of people with his speeches.', 'Why not go after a bjp ruled state... do we want to further decimate opposition?\nAt this point, all opposition should work together or it will be like bihar elections where ljp eat out votes of jdu and rjd, leaving bjp candidates to win...\n\nSp, bsp, congress dont have a chance in up... we dont want ajay bisht to be two term cm, do we?', 'Yeah not worshiping one man but every team has a captain... and to build we need to start somewhere n with someone...\n\nInstitutions to keep government in check were there - EC, CBI, IT, ED, SC, HC, media ...\nBut as long as humans are involved they can be infiltrated, bought, threatened or replaced...\n\nWe need more choices... in right and left and centre...\nNo one party should get all votes...\nIf we cannot shift people from right to left, atleast give them a second choice...', 'Yeah thats the point right... lesser of the two evils... we need a right wing party to win a right wing state...\n\nWe cannot flip states overnight from right to left...', 'Yeah. But isnt that same as what ajay bisht and modi have done? We need more choices of similar candidates so that people dont go put all their votes in one party...\n\nI think aap did well with mohalla clinics, education in delhi. With UP he will either show his true fakeness or his true statesman ship.\n\nAs i said he is no saint and is soft hindutava...', 'I agree to this part. If they declare priyanka as CM they could have a better chance. BJP will then do ‚Äúbeti o beti‚Äù instead of ‚Äúdidi o didi‚Äù but they can plan to counter.\n\nUnfortunately priyanka hasnt done any ground work/support. She just tweets and puts questions there. She wasnt seen on streets and with people as rahul does... to be honest she isnt politician or fully in public service yet. \nBut yeah thats congress best bet as per me. I might be wrong...', ""> Yeah not worshiping one man but every team has a captain... and to build we need to start somewhere n with someone...\n\nVery apt analogy. When making a team, you dont go and scout for a captain. You find able people to play in the team, and then select a captain out of them. \n\nAnd that's what our parliamentary democracy is. If we the selectors, send the best player from each of our constituency, any one of those players can step up and be the captain. What we need is massive information, educative campaigns, teaching the people the importance of voting and supporting the best candidate in their local constituency, instead of the party, accountability at local level, and local media everywhere to keep those local leaders at check.\n\n> Institutions to keep government in check were there - EC, CBI, IT, ED, SC, HC, media ... But as long as humans are involved they can be infiltrated, bought, threatened or replaced...\n\nAnd that's the hardest part to fix. We need to have ethical law enforcement and need a tonne of reforms to make sure that autonomy of these institutions are not compromised, and heavy punishment for transgressors.\n\nI don't know how we can achieve all of the above, and how long its gonna take, if at all. May be we are all just doomed and destined to live a life like this."", 'But people dont get this\n\n ‚Äúselect best player from each of our constituencies, any one of tose players can step up and be the captain‚Äù\n\nCongress lives by this rule. They dont declare a cm candidate or pm candidate. Because if that candidate doesnt get elected then how can they be cm/pm.\nThey have proven this by example. In rajasthan, then pradesh head CP Joshi lost election by 1 vote. He was prime cm candidate. But didnt win. Gehlot was made CM again based on who was best among winners.\n\nPeople dont get this though. They think congress doesnt declare because they sneakily want Rahul to be PM if they ever win. \n\nOnly way to achieve morals and ethics is through education. Not literacy but education. Teachers, parents play a vital role in this. Unfortunately our right wing citizens are right now also preaching children to be right wing. Some are full of hate. While we strive for better education in long term. We need a short term fix...\n\nAnd that my friend is giving an alternative right wing party and leader. Alternative to BJP and Modi...\nTo win the game, play the game...']"
n1raz8,"GNCTD ACT , this is how I have summarized the various reasons and reaction. What are your views on this act?","The LG will now be the effective in charge of delhi according to the the new GNCTD act which came into effect on 27th april.
According to this act, the govt  of delhi now means the liutenant governor. 

The three sectors which are law and order, land and police come under the central government  while all the other subject come under the Delhi government. Now the delhi govt. will need to have an approval from the LG for every decision they take under their dominion . Every bill passed by the legislative assembly now needs a permission from the LG to be implemented.

The supreme court pronounced its judgment on 4 July 2018; it said the lieutenant governor of Delhi had no independent decision-making powers and was bound to follow the ""aid and advice"" of the Delhi chief-minister-headed council of ministers of the Government of Delhi.

In their defence, the central govt has said that the act has been brought to remove the obscurity from the already existing laws. They believe that Delhi govt. should not have full powers as Delhi is not a full fledged state. The executive powers of the LG of delhi should be different from those of the governors of the full fledged states.

The aam aadmi party being antagonistic towards the act has termed the day on which the bill was passed a ""sad day for democracy"".
It believes that the bill is an unconstitutional attempt by the BJP to raise LG's powers and make the delhi govt. impuissant to rule Delhi indirectly after losing the state elections. The AAP is now also planning to approach the supreme court for the same.",2021-04-30 10:51:24,"['Please follow @thefairside on Instagram for more unswayed and critical analysis of political happenings in India', 'What are the chances of the supreme court overturning the Act?']"

You can dump a single OS into all the laptops in the world, which if you didn't know Microsoft has been doing for 25 years now.

lvvqcw,"Digital Transparency: A Right to Information Report for February, 2021","https://preview.redd.it/25mcbjll7kk61.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=71558184fdd789432f2b1d367195cad793fd98f3

## tl;dr

Since our last report in the month of [**January**](https://internetfreedom.in/digital-transparency-a-right-to-information-report-for-january-2021/), IFF has filed 41 RTI requests. Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.

## Why is transparency important?

The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.

The Right to Information Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with and demand transparency and accountability from the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of January, we have up till now filed 32 RTI requests with authorities at the Central and State level, both electronically and through physical filing on the various issues on which we engage with the government.

**Note**: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month's report may be included in the present report.

## Data Protection and Privacy

One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 28 requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.

Under IFF‚Äôs [**Project Panoptic**](https://panoptic.in/), we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with:

## Free Speech and Censorship

Our other main focus is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people‚Äôs fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.

In the last month, we have filed 13 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:

1. The [**Ministry of Home Affairs**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mYN63R3aeOSx97XNrwo22dst1DdTopEx/view?usp=sharing) on the reported internet shutdowns which took place in New Delhi on January 26, 2021.

Then they ask you to pay the amount of the second item via GPay or NetBanking to an account that they provide, and that they will send you the order ID and it will be delivered to your address in 2 days.

**Takeaways** \-

1. getting a ""call"" saying you won a gift - big no-no
2. getting selected for a gift that requires a payment on your side - possible scam
3. stranger asking you to transfer money to an unknown account - likely scam

**Long version**: (maybe too long as I want to include all relevant details that I can remember, so that people know exactly what to look out for)

Today I got a call from a guy claiming to be from ""Amazon Gifts Department"", saying that I had been chosen as today's lucky customer and that I was eligible for a gift free-of-cost. (*He somehow had my address and the details of the last order I placed, so I had to change my Amazon password).*  
Scam alarms in my head went off instantly, backed by the fact that their phone number looked like a consumer number, and that the guy was speaking in broken english and not in coherent sentences. The truecaller search showed that they tried to make their online presence pretty believable, but their [amazon.in](https://amazon.in) email is not legit (confirmed by a friend who works at Amazon India).  
Still, I played on with his charades innocently, just to lead him on and then to bring his hopes crashing  
back down :p

This is my conversation with the guy:

SCAMMER - Hello, am I speaking to OP?

OP - Yes, who is this?

SCAMMER - Sir, I'm calling from **Amazon's Gifts Department**. You recently You have been chosen as today's lucky customer and you are eligible for a gift totally free of cost. You can choose from a Sony BRAVIA LED TV, Apple iPhone 11, Dell Inspiron 15"" laptop, LG Refrigerator, and <one more thing which I forgot>.

OP - OK, I want the iPhone 11 *(I was looking to buy a phone for my brother, so why not)*

SCAMMER - OK Sir, I've noted your choice of gift. Please search on Amazon using the code ""B08L8BV998"" *(this is the product code for iPhone 11)* and you'll see the iPhone 11 show up. Then add it to your cart.

OP - `*searches and adds the item in cart*`

SCAMMER - To receive the gift, **you must add one more item to cart, priced 5k or above**. Then you'll just have to pay for your chosen item and you'll get both the gift and the thing that you chose in your order. Your gift and your order will be delivered to your address within 2 days.

*(I'm a Prime subscriber and none of my orders are delivered in less than a week LOL)*

OP - `*adds an item worth 19k and tells him what I added*`

SCAMMER - `*eyes sparkling with hope*`  
 Thanks for choosing <my-item> Sir, I can confirm that you have <my-item> and one iPhone 11 in your cart totalling Rs 78k. You'll only have to pay Rs. 19k for <my-item> and you'll get both the items. You'll also be **getting a 20-40% cash back** on your payment method within 2-3 business days.

*(This just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?)*

OP - I'll pay via GPay

SCAMMER - Sir please open your Gpay app and go to **Bank Transfer** section. Enter **""Amazon's bank account details"" as Account Name: AMAZON** Account Number and IFSC: <dont-remember>.

*(Fuckers think that just because the've created a bank account named AMAZON, people will think it's legit. I was too bored to continue at this point)*

OP - *Bhag <hindi expletive> kisi aur ko chutiya banana* (Get lost, you bugger, go scam someone else).

jekwd8,Genuine query- is it better to buy a good DSLR/Mirrorless camera instead of an iPhone or Galaxy s20?,"I don't know much about photography, but I am willing to learn. 

I am curious about the potential of a reasonable (<50k) camera setup, which can last at least a decade. DSLR and Mirrorless cameras cost that much for the base models, maybe with some accessories included. I do not need any NatGeo or Discovery type footage, just good pictures of landscapes and maybe timelapse videos of the sky or scenery , and normal pics when I travel with the family. I will use a normal tripod for the latter. 

One option is to get a good gimbal and an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy that costs upwards of 70k and gets obsolete in 3 years. Another is to buy a basic Samsung or Asus android phone for less than 10k, and invest in a good camera setup that will last at least a decade. 

I will be grateful for suggestions. Portability is not a concern.

I use an LG G6 currently which has a great camera, but the phone has slowed a lot since 2017 and I paid a lot of money for it then. Even my Pixel 2 Xl and my sister's iPhone 7 has slowed, though the camera is great. Hence I am skeptical about spending on a smartphone based on the camera because these things become obsolete in 2-4 years.",2020-10-20 07:42:19,"[""I can try and give you my input. I'm using a Nikon D3100 that I bought in 2014. The camera itself was manufactured in 2010 I think.\n\nIn the last 5 years, I have taken images like [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/au7lq7/1_exposure_vs_120_exposures_stacked_together_i/) or [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/j3ty70/6_year_progress_with_the_exact_same_cheap/) and [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/hc06yz/1_vs_240_most_of_the_milky_way_shots_we_see_have/) and [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ij5oes/i_took_these_images_in_2017_at_the_gwalior_fort/)\n\nMost of these were taken with the kit lens that came with the camera or a cheap telephoto lens that I bought (~5000 Rs) .\n\nThe camera itself cost me 19K and I had only bought this model because it was the cheapest camera on Amazon/Flipkart.\n\n The only drawback with phone cameras is that their sensor size is considerably smaller than DSLRs, and the fact that you can't have any interchangeable lens on it (though I'm guessing these days some adapters are available online)\n\nSo if your only use case is to take casual images that you share on social media, a Mobile camera is completely fine. Especially if you use the manual/pro mode, or use a gcam mod.\n\nIf you think you want to capture 'difficult' shots like wildlife photography, or Astrophotography(that's what I do), or sports and stuff, then you can buy a dedicated camera.\n\nPersonally, I only use my camera when I'm doing some Astrophotography, and for all other purposes- family shots, selfies, trips- my OnePlus 5T seems perfectly capable."", ""Here ia my thinking. The best camera is the one you have with you when you want to take a picture. You may have the world most expensive camera but it's useless if at home when you need to take a picture."", ""I don't get the costly phone thing when it becomes useless after 3 or 4 years.\n\nBut a camera lasts long, batteries are replaceable, different lens can be used for different types of pictures. And the investment motivates you to become good at it. It's a tool, not a fun thingy.\n\nSmartphone pictures don't even come close to the look of the large sensor of a camera. If the colors, composition and lighting is good, it's almost impossible for a typical viewer to tell if the image is shot on an entry level camera or a high end one. But everyone can tell if it's shot on a phone or a camera. Phones can fake the bokeh, but they can't fake the sensor."", 'Definitely', 'A phone with some add on can provide great image quality but if you want some pro features like adjusting iso and all that you are better off with a camera. That being said if you are upgrading your camera & phone maybe go for a two in one option ?', ""I feel that a DSLR would be more customisable compared to phones, because you can change it's lens if you want to.    \n\nIf you want to take casual photos, and want a smaller package, go with a phone. I would definitely recommend the Google Pixel 4a since it has a top notch camera (comparable to the 11 Pro Max)"", ""If you're serious about photography, then a standalone dslr or a mirrorless camera would run laps around a phone camera. It comes down to the size of the imaging sensor. Thats the reason a 108 megapixel photo from a Samsung S20 will come nowhere close to the quality you'd get from a 10 year old DSLR like the Canon 60D which can capture much higher fidelity and have much better low noise performance with just 18 megapixels. If your budget is around 50k I'd highly recommend the Nikon D5600 kit: https://www.amazon.in/Nikon-D5600-18-55-70-300-Memory/dp/B01N58T6KA/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=dslr&qid=1603191881&sr=8-2\n\nThe two lenses should cover pretty much the entire range of photography you'd want to do. \n\nOf course the flip side of going with a phone is obviously having much more functionality beyond just a camera."", 'Start with a phone. iPhone 8 Plus have great picture if used properly \n\nStart with Samsung/Iphone then move to DSLR as your skills improve', 'Hey man\nthese suggestions are all great.I also bought a poco f1 just for some random photography to keep track of memories.But the camera quality starts to downgrade after a few months and this has happened with almost all android phones I bought.\nAlso it becomes clunky and starts lagging due to updates unless I keep it very clean and use less apps \nI had the 6gb/64gb variant which I will use for another year maybe by installing another OS \n\n\nOn the other hand my Canon 70d(2013 manufactured and purchsed in 2015) has been going great and if you start getting deep into then it gives you more freedom to shoot raw images.\n\nWhatever decision you take I wanted to let you know that I am willing to sell all my photography gear because now I use a sony and ronin etc for professional shoots so I dont use the DSLR anymore and its been lying for no reason.ive got other acceasories whicu I want to sell of as well\n\nLet me know if youre interested :)', '[deleted]', ""So just to clarify, if I don't care about astrophotography, sports or wildlife, a good phone camera is almost as good as DSLRs?

Also, with a camera you always have the option of upgrading to a better lens(like a prime lens) and/or a different type of lens(macro, telephoto etc) later, but with smartphones you are limited to what it can do out of the box. Smartphones these days do come with multiple cameras, but I honestly don't feel like they're too useful.\n\nI mean, if you want to take an image of the Moon, I doubt any telephoto camera in any smartphone these days will be able to help."", ""If you're only looking to share your shots (portraits, simple landscape) on social media, they're usually compressed enough already that these days phone cameras are _almost_ able to take pictures comparable to DSLRs. \n\nOh and I forgot this before, but for low light photography, I think phone cameras are still a few years behind DSLRs.

iemija,Recommendation for a new TV for my parents,"Looking to buy a new TV for my parent's bedroom. They still have that old style fat TV, so a much needed upgrade here. 

Initially I was thinking of getting a non-smart TV along with firestick to save some money but a quick glance at amazon seems like almost all the new models are smart tv, so it make sense to go with a smart tv now.

- Budget - 30k(can extend a few 1000s)

- 32 or 43 inches. (I am not sure if I should go for the expensive 32 or cheaper 43, their bed isnt very far from the wall(bed edge is around 4 ft away, so they will be around 9 ft away from the tv) so maybe 32 inches make more sense).

- I am thinking of going for Full HD, but if 4k comes in the budget - sure. But we wont be streaming any 4k content in the near future.

- I am looking for something which is future proof as I don't think they will be upgrading it for at least 7-10 years. Not sure whats the life of they new smart tvs these days.

i3emzg,The draft EIA 2020 and why it is insidiously problematic,"Post the Bhopal gas leak tragedy, the government realized the need for stronger environmental laws in order to assess the impact of industrial and infrastructure projects on our natural resources and thus the **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)** norms were rolled out in 1994. Under these rules, it became mandatory to seek Environmental Clearance (EC) **prior** to the expansion or setting up of new industrial or modernization projects like mining, thermal power plants, river valley, infrastructure (road, highway, ports, harbours and airports) etc.

Earlier in March 2020, when the country was in lockdown, the GoI proposed a new draft for EIA to make the process more ""transparent and expedient"".

Activists, especially those based in TN, contend that this draft is nothing but a rehashing of the TSR committee report on overhauling environmental laws, which was roundly rejected by the Parliamentary Standing Committee back in 2015 on the grounds that [""it would result in an unacceptable dilution of the existing legal and policy architecture established to protect our environment""](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/parliamentary-standing-committee-rejects-tsr-subramanian-report-on-environmental-laws-50577). You would also remember this as the time when that IB report ""leaked"" about how foreign-funded NGOs in India like Greenpeace etc are ""a threat to national security and development"".

Cut to July 2020, when Greta Thungberg's NGO decided to make a coordinated effort to send mails to the Environment Ministry raising concerns about the EIA draft, they were first **booked under the UAPA, which was later deemed to be a ""clerical"" error and then further booked under the IT Act for ""sending too many emails"".** [Their website is still blocked in India](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/uapa-charge-in-notice-to-environmental-group-fridays-for-future-due-to-clerical-error-delhi-police-1703716-2020-07-23).

Coming to the draft itself, listed below are the most controversial proposed changes -

1. **Post-facto clearance** \- Remember that Vizag gas leak tragedy in May? [That chemical plant was running without an EC for many years.](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/vizag-gas-tragedy-lg-polymers-lacked-environmental-clearance-before-chemical-gas-leak-616707) Under this new change, if LG Polymers had simply sought clearance or paid a fine before the disaster occurred, it would've been a-okay. Oh and funny thing, [in an order on April 1, the Supreme Court held ‚Äúex post facto environmental clearances‚Äù contrary to law](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/sc-sets-aside-ngts-directions-regarding-ex-post-facto-environmental-clearance) but still the govt persists.
2. **Suo moto declaration of violation** \- There are two ways in which flouting of environmental laws can be punished - either the govt catches you red-handed or you self-report and pay a fine. The public can no longer report such rule-breaking.
3. **Strategic exemptions** \- In the list of projects that will not be up for a public consultation, there's a new and arbitrary category called ""strategic projects"" as decided by the Central Govt. Also, border area projects will be exempt too, where ""border area"" is defined as 'area falling within 100 kilometres aerial distance from the LAC with bordering countries of India."" So most of the Northeast, the repository of the country‚Äôs richest biodiversity.
4. **Response times shortened while clearance validity extended** \- In a double whammy, the public only gets 20 days (from the previous 30) to peruse a proposed project plan and make objections or suggestions, if any. OTOH, most projects now enjoy a greater validity for their existing ECs, for ex - a mining company's EC validity has been extended 30 to 50 years while nuclear power plants have been bumped to 15 years from the previous 5. Companies also now only have to furnish environmental compliance reports annually instead of bi-annually.

hzh67g,"r/India, How do you buy electronics/appliances for a lower price in India?","r/India, 

As the title reads, I'm trying to furnish my apartment that i've recently moved into now. I'm facing an issue which most of you would have faced. It bloody costs a lot. The real issue starts when every vendor you talk to gives you a different price. Some varying as wide as over 30%. Eg. I looked at this particular LG OLED TV. I got price quotes of anywhere from 1.5L-2.90L. Amazon/Flipkart/Croma have it for about 2.2L. Same with the Washing machine that i was looking at. I got offers from 23k-39k for the exact same model with everything included. Even the goddamn installation (Whatever that means for a washing machine. Lol) What is going on here and mind you that all of the prices are from dealers. With GST Invoice and manufacturers warranty. 

Then, there are your friends who tell you to wait till the pandemic is over and fly down to Dubai, pay duties and you'd still save atleast 30-40% of the cost. There are innumerable Indian youtubers that have vlogs on this too. How far this is true is something that i cannot decide or comment upon, given my lack of experience and knowledge.

TLDR: How do i pay the lowest possible price for all the electronic equipments or household electronic appliances in India? Primarily the TV, Washing machine and a refrigerator.

I am in Mumbai if that matters.

Rant: Let me not even get started on the furnitures. Oh god almighty i was offered a recliner that i saw on olx for 8k from anywhere between 14-30k in the offline market. I am not okay with pepperfry or urbanladder. Most friends have quality issues with their orders from there. So any suggestions for this too?

hu473j,[Self Post] Discussion: Aam Aadmi Party as a Political Alternative in Modi-fied India,"From the run-up to the February 2020 assembly elections in Delhi till today, there has been a surge in discussions among inclusive, secular and empathetic thinkers that speculate about the right-shifting of AAP. These voices, which one might think would have been natural allies to AAP now question it on numerous issues that have come up lately, and many times rightly so.

One example would be the points raised in the article and following discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/htcea9/not_knowing_where_else_to_go_aap_is_moving_to_the/).

## Objective

This is a post where I highlight some of my observations, and the key points of conflict that left-leaning, liberal thinking, secular minded individuals might have with its current avatar. I'd also try to decouple discourse on public policy (budgets on sectors, key reforms, law making, public services) vs. politics (public communication, campaign strategies, narratives in media). Let's try to make this a thread of nuanced, civil and respectful discussion. Let's engage with one another on any topic that emerges from this.

While the firebrand right-wing refers to AAPians with monikers like ""naxali"", ""antanki"", ""jihaadi"", ""anarchists"" among various others, the BJP-opposing thinkers express their concerns from ""right-shifting politics"", ""Hindu-appeasement"" all the way to ""next Modi"" and ""RSS's B-Team"". This thread is to discuss the concerns of the second group. 

Please feel free to ask for sources for anything I write here.

## Evolution of AAP from 2015-2020: Bullet Points

## 1. Victory and Clipped Wings

2015's win in Delhi was historic and most opinion polls couldn't predict the margin of victory. However, the celebration was short lived. Anti-Corruption Branch, which was formerly under the Delhi Govt. was taken away by force. Then the powers under the umbrella of ""Services"" were taken away as well, which made any appointment/removal/transfer in the Delhi Govt. a subject under the appointed LG. Supreme Court gave some relief with policy related matters to the local government though the conflict with services and ACB remain unresolved.

## 2. Angry-Young-Man Style Demeanour

Tried to copy CM Modi's style of opposition where a local leader also talks about pressing national level issues, be it fake encounters, dalit atrocities in universities, centre trying to suppress dissent, etc. This with a touch of radical anger with ""coward and psychopath"" commentary on top leadership at the center.

This starts to fail miserably. Modi's image was larger than life and this was a style of ""less decent"" conduct which many supporters of AAP couldn't easily accept either.

Highlighting corruption nationwide actually led to a huge number of legal issues for the party. Ultimately, in order be able to focus on local governance, AK had to issue apologies to get the cases dissolved. More context [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/85489b/kejriwals_court_hearing_list_in_march_2018_based/).

## 3. 2017 Electoral Losses

AAP saw a last minute setback in Punjab where they underperformed opinion polls. Disappointing performance in Goa. Complete loss of face in MCD elections as well. AAP soon realised that this kind of all out ""Nayak"" attack on the establishment needs to be tempered down.

## 4. 2019 Lok Sabha

In Delhi, even with exemplary candidates, AAP lost its vote-share to Congress. It was not seen as a national player even in a supposed parliamentary democracy. Even in Punjab, they could only win 1 seat. The whole campaign was centred around replacing BJP and full-statehood of Delhi.

An example of the openly anti-BJP narrative played out is here with Kunal Kamra's interview where AK openly criticised Modi's communal/divisive rule, Amit Shah and the lack of autonomy of Delhi: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPtxYO65ZIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPtxYO65ZIU)

## 5. Rebranding with #KaamKiBaat

Started focussing on local issues and ensuring prompt delivery of poll promises. SC's relief started paying dividends on the policy front. Realized that taking Modi's persona head-on won't work among those who revere him.

BJP tried to polarise the atmosphere with Shaheen Bagh, calling AK as a terrorist and calling AAP a party of radical Islamists. It took huge restraint to not get sucked up in the Shaheen Bagh trap intentionally set by BJP. BJP also tried to polarise by making practicing Hindu families take a ""gangajal ki kasam"" with their ""dharam ka namak"" (loyalty to religion) rhetoric. 200+ BJP MPs and several BJP CMs were on the streets campaigning. Amit Shah himself delivered rallies for MLA candidates and did door-to-door campaigns.

AAP continued a positive campaign with their ""Guarantee Card"" and manifesto as seen in all local campaigns, town halls and rallies at that time. It used Hanuman to counter the ""anti-Hindu"" narrative that was prevailing on the ground. Nevertheless, BJP gained 6% voteshare.

People basically pronounced their verdict: They gave full marks to AAP's work, but emphasised that their religion matters big.

## Key Observations

1. Modi's image and popularity among masses gets stronger and stronger despite horrible policy blunders that adversely impacted everything. TINA, strongman image and #hinduKhatreMeinHain were the key talking points.
2. Practically all the key leaders of the anti-CAA protests, from NGOs to independent thinkers are being booked and hounded by the police. AAP MLAs were already witch-hunted long before this, imagine what could have happened if AAP leaders publicly participated. There is a binary created: Pro-CAA: Patriotic; Anti-CAA: Anti-national.
3. BJP won with 56% vote share in LS-2019 elections. AAP cannot possibly win anywhere in northern India if its tent cannot accommodate those who vote for Modi based on fear-mongering propaganda.

## ABC of Mass Campaigns for Indian Voters

* **A - Amygdala**: The reptile part of the human brain that makes decisions based on deeply held notions that are not easily impacted by logic/reason. BJP's campaigns try to activate this side of human thinking when they fear-monger that daughters and mothers would be raped if BJP is defeated.
* **B - Batua**: The wallet that hurts when Indians spend an overwhelming amount of money and time on just getting the basics. Fundamentals like healthcare, education, fair wages, clean water, reliable power, housing, etc are still pipe dreams for most Indians. Anything that gives them a little bit of more money in hands works. Example: 15 L in every account!
* **C - Culture**: India is a deeply religious country with multiple pockets of cultures and sub-cultures. Indians prefer a form a secularism that publicly displays religious/communal identities as opposed to the European style where things are more agnostic to it publicly. There is always an air of insecurities and disproportionate priorities that come with this.

Any political alternative in the Modi-fied India must tick these three boxes. It is possible to tick the C box without antagonising/persecuting some other pocket of culture. Likewise A can also be ticked without negative fear mongering using ""otherization"".

## Public Policy and Power

In this community, I suppose one need not elaborate much about the policy victories of AAP and how its administration has actually delivered on things which every Indian should have had. The transformation of schools, the way healthcare has become much more inclusive, piped water and power is more affordable, doorstep delivery of services has plugged many avenues for corruption, etc

None of these essential policies to tackle deep inequities could happen without power. As idealist opposition or NGOs, there is little that can be done to influence policy. In power, there is an opportunity to showcase a different model of governance altogether. Budget documents give the first impression of a government's priorities. AAP puts 25% on education, about 15% on healthcare.

## Friction between Anti-BJP Thinkers and AAP

There is overarching agreement to most policies of AAP and its budgetary priorities. However, lately there have been disagreements which have led to more fragmentation among those one may have otherwise expected to be AAP supporting. There are 5 major kinds of disagreements here:

## 1. Flavour of Secularism/Role of Religion

In recent days, AAP has moved from the public image of European-style secularism to the kind where religious identities are clearly visible. This has not gone well with many thinkers who feel that religious symbolism in public life is the first step to actual religious pandering.

An example of such decisions is the pilgrimage scheme for the underprivileged to 12 different routes of which two cater to Sikhs and Buddhists and the rest to Hindus (of various origins). Another would be construction of a Hajj House in Delhi by the Delhi Govt. These steps are seen as some form of religious appeasement.

## 2. Tempered-Down Opposition Politics

As mentioned before, AAP has tempered down the degree to which AAP leaders comment on national issues as opposition. Greater focus is on Delhi's governance and any opposition is made in that context. Like regulation of power prices in Delhi is shown in the context of rising prices in the other cities.

AAP being a small outfit with limited resources was constantly battered with lawsuits. Even for the Rafale Scam, the only defamation case filed by Ambani's company is against AAP's Sanjay Singh! For greater focus, this tempering was seen as necessary.

It is necessary to break labling of AAP leaders as squealing children or reckless communists who want to give away everything free. Nuances on governmental roadblocks in Delhi and fiscally prudent welfare economics are lost to most people.

## 3. Anti-Corruption Rhetoric

ACB and Services are not in AAP's purview. Openly speaking about it but not being able to act on it can prove detrimental. Instead, policy-based solutions to plug corruption are being used, like doorstep delivery, eRTI in all government institutions, savings in civil projects, collective negotiation to bring down costs of healthcare services/medications/vaccinations, efficient tax collection to boost revenues, etc.

There is cartel of the bureaucrats who are in total control of the central government that add to friction in governance. Ensuring a modicum of smoothness in operation is essential. Jan Lokpal Bill which was passed within months of being elected in 2015 is still lying under LG's posterior.

## 4. Pragmatism with Judicial Cases

AAP is also being cautious with talking about judicial cases against activists/protesters which has also raised concerns. For some people, this is evidence enough to prove without doubt that AAP is a Sanghi organization in disguise. However, Delhi Govt's legal team consisting of prosecutors led by Rahul Mehra have been countering Sanghi machinery behind the curtain.

Delhi Police is unfortunately an important part of governing Delhi. Things will start to collapse if Delhi Police stops cooperating the local government. Security of ministers and MLA is handled by them. They are supposed to be also doing a big chunk of tracking and tracing work with the COVID crisis.

While role of Delhi Police in riots/civil unrest was highlighted by AAP leaders, they caution themselves from going thermonuclear on them. Example here with the recent JNU attacks and police inaction: [https://youtu.be/bt\_YJ4Csjbs](https://youtu.be/bt_YJ4Csjbs)

## 5. Centralisation of Political Decisions in AAP

There is also a prevailing narrative that Kejriwal himself takes every decision in the party and it is extremely centralized with negligible internal democracy. However, the party is expanding its public discourse across several leaders and their media spokespersons. This should be a welcome move as the party expands.

Likewise, its state units are operating independently with protests on rising fuel prices, power prices, labor law dilution, EIA 2020 draft, etc. This should also be a welcome as narratives work differently in different parts of the country. This is best done by local political activists.

hchnsg,how India can successfully ban china?," 

please correct me if I'm wrong these are my opinions what are yours tell me

a lot of media channels have shown us visuals of people braking tv's and phones but is that enough

no 

we might not buy Chinese but they will find some other market as well here is what I feel should be done 

# 

below is my opinion on how we can at least become a tough competitor to china and put a hole in his wallet

* Role of the government
* role of people
* role of companies
* sectors we should target

# Raw materials:-

1. buying cheaper petroleum from OPEC plus counties and buying petroleum currently or when the price is low petroleum is the most basic necessary material needed to start making anything like a cellphone body or any plastic part it is necessary we get petroleum and not make the payment in petrodollars but in INR as it will help save the expensive foreign dollar
2. rare earth minerals, partnerships with Australia and African counties to make an agreement where Indian mining companies will open an associate in their country and provide employment there in return for being able to access rare earth minerals and its beneficial both ways,
3. refining of these raw materials is largely not done in India currently, we would require them to be purified in India or any other country where it is most feasible or where there are already built plants made to process these plants eg, Taiwan South Korea and Japan.

# Product manufacturing:-

* the most lucrative sector is smartphones and electronics that phrase china is the electronics store in the world holds true.

1. government has to make it lucrative for foreign brands to open manufacturing plants in India.

* most smartphone components that we can make in India or source from friendly countries are
* batteries from Samsung and LG & sony can be currently sourced for quality batteries
* processors from companies like Exynos from Samsung and MediaTek from Taiwan
* texas instruments from America & Broadcom

using the design from ARM a Uk based processor architecture license firm

ARM is the only licenser of processor design which is used in smartphones and other smart devices

the government of India can experiment with funding a department to make processors that are compatible with other makers at least reaching 80% capacity in terms of performance or fund any Indian company who tries to make processer in India in house

**Memory**

[memory manufacturers from countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flash_memory_controller_manufacturers)

using the above list we can choose partners and offer them land that is near a port or away from agricultural land so that a plant can be set up that can make memory modules being both NAND flash and storage memory and controllers

controllers, rectifiers and other smaller electronics components like capacitors clippers should be made in India as China is the only current economical manufacturer of these components

this will require skilled labor, engineers, and people who have had expertise in the industry and manufacturing field as economies of scale play a big factor in these parts hiring people who have had the first-hand experience in other companies should be offered jobs in India

* cameras for phones are majorly made by brands

1. Samsung
2. sony
3. OmniVision (Chinese) should be not used
4. zies (luxury brand)
5. Panasonic

if these companies cameras are used they can provide good camera experience in the smartphones and tablets

# connectivity chips

most connectivities chips are made by Qualcomm or MediaTek using a generation old parts from other manufacturers or a little weaker ones won't break the product tbh

Accessories for electronics

another market that seems appropriate is electronics accessories like:-

* cables
* chargers
* headphones
* keyboard
* mouses
* pen drives
* memory cards
* powerbanks
* cases
* covers
* dongles

these products are also dominated by Chinese brands globally we should just copy their design in these segments and also export these products as there are sold in big numbers at least for every smartphone we have a couple of pair of earphones and a power bank a lot of these Chinese brands are known for bad service if we can provide better after-sales we can get a good chunk of the market even if the price is 10-20% extra,

and I guess the easiest to target market sector as well as it requires considerably less R&D

the equipment used for manufacturing

* most of the manufacturing is done by robots or machines made in china
* using these machines we cant justify any product that is made in India but used Chinese tools to make them
* either reverse engineering these machines to make them here or using machines from a competitor or non-Chinese brands
* having some grants for using non-Chinese equipment has to be provided by the government
* Chinese products have been manufactured by state of the art factories having high efficiency and quality control resulting in yields that have fewer failure rates and thus fewer duds
* having some quality control team that used to work in China is the most beneficial

branding of the products

most Indian brands are synonymous with

1. cheap brands
2. poor build
3. unreliable components
4. mediocre performance
5. poor after-sales service
6. better alternatives

the image problem can be fixed by gorilla marketing and having a pr team that does advertising in global markets

all the rest can be fixed by jugged and better workmanship

if the markets react positively the services will also improve

products should be targeted towards the starting range or entry-level or mid-tier as peoples expectations from expensive product grows more as the price increases.

we can be white label brands as well but that seems tougher as china is the biggest white label brand hub as well

**software**

* android can be left stock and with very few modifications required for the beginning
* we have big IT companies that have good experience building apps for big clients

utility apps are where we need to focus most on

an alternative to these apps are required

1. tik-tok
2. Share it
3. miui share
4. cam scanner
5. PicsArt
6. currency converter
7. video editors
8. financial apps as most startups in India are currently funded by foreign brands and some have big investors from China as the Chinese government and other Chinese entities fund applications to flood markets and to get a stake hold in the financial part of most countries examples are
9. swiggy
10. paytm

# countries we should target

[sort in increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita)[ order and take countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita)[ from 1500 USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita)[ to 5000 USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita)

exceptions will be there but we should target such counties where there is a growing emerging market that still doesn't have a lot of contenders

usual markets

African developing countries

middle east

Central Asia

and Latin America

other sectors where we can compete with china

# automobiles

India has some automobile ingrown manufacturers who can make safe cars that will be able to be sold in Latin America & African market

whose demands are similar to ours so a lot of r&d is already done for it

have simple no-fuss mechanicals efficient engines ,

don't look old or clunky and can handle extreme heat and rain as well

some examples are for commercial and two-wheelers as well

* tata
* Mahindra
* bajaj
* TVS
* hero
* Royal Enfield
* eicher
* Ashok Leyland

they are economically cheaper than their European counterparts and for daily use

having cars that can be used daily for 5 years will be a good selling point also we have to export more bikes as well bikes are a big seller in the emerging markets

* **raw chemicals**
* **medicines**
*  **software (application, support, utility )**
* **cloths**
* **fruits**
* **vegetables**
* **plastic components**

# What the government can do

1. have PSUS in the electronic & telecommunication technologies department so that the brain drain is reduced so that talented individuals can help develop our country and be proud of making something in their own country and be the owner of it
2. have more innovative ideas as china has not just copied products but is now a leader in modern and sophisticated devices we would need to invent and innovate to be on the cutting edge and be the second option but be the first option everyone considers
3. have specific trade corridors that are away from residential areas and provide these lands at cheaper rates to lure the companies into states that have lower development or where land is still cheaper
4. have research hubs where people can innovate on their ideas and propose it to companies
5. provide funding to companies so that even if the loose money in the first few years they still stay competitive and not end up being owned by some foreign brands
6. make ease of doing business be increased
7. focus on exporting more after our internal demand has been fulfilled
8. investment by big corporates into these startups and fdas by friendly companies or companies from countries that help India should be made easily countries like Japan and Germany and Russia should be allowed to have fdas easily as these countries have always helped us through thick and thin for which I thank them even though Russia has helped both countries as well
9. skilled labour is the need of the hour if we have the biggest youth population and they can spend their free time on TikTok won't it be better if they took up learning some skill that can provide them with a source of income as well also people who couldn't study due to financial reasons are in their mid-30s and are a bit behind could be helped a lot of the government can start skill training with psus for certain specific employment scenarios

gz2u1l,A nuanced critique on Delhi Govt's decision to reduce testing criteria and reserve Delhi hospitals for Delhi residents.,"Folks here seem to be split on this issue, so as a person who voted for AAP frequently, I thought I'd give my honest and nuanced take on this issue.

https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/india/story/anyone-can-get-treated-for-covid-19-in-delhi-govt-hospitals-l-g-overrules-arvind-kejriwal-s-order-1686873-2020-06-08

Just few hours ago LG of Delhi overruled both these decisions and despite the nature of LG being undemocratic, I actually agree with him on these issues. Let me explain why.

1. On testing: I think most people will agree that Delhi Govt's decision to reduce the testing criteria is disastrous. By choosing to only test symptomatic patients, knowing well that asymptomatic people can also be spreaders and can also later develop symptoms, it makes Delhi a ticking time bomb. The countries which have effectively controlled the spread use the exact opposite strategy and stop potential spreaders from roaming around. In short term the numbers might look less, but long term it will continue to increase and essentially overwhelm and collapse our hospitals.


2. On reserving hospitals for Delhi residents: We all know about lack of beds and hospitals filling up with patients already. It is a very very serious problem. But the solution they have chosen is absolutely asinine. Here's why. Indians are Indians no matter which state they belong to. All Indian lives matter. You can't pick and chose who gets treatment on which state they belong to. This is creating division more than it might help anybody.

So Do I have any solution?

The solution to both these problems are obvious. Like other countries, Increase testing capacity to as much as possible now, so you will see a bump now but when the curve flattens you will have the last laugh.

Secondly, increase the capacity of hospitals and beds constantly non stop. I am sure they have done it to some extent but if hospitals are already full, then it wasn't sufficient. Do more of that, get beds in a stadium/gymnasium or any empty space, get doctors and help from other states. This is a nationwide emergency, we are all in this together. We are not citizens of Delhi, UP or Bihar. We are citizens of India.

One good counter argument I can think of. Central govt took way too long to release GST meant for states and is not giving sufficient aid that aligns with the urgency of this situation. Hence without this help they cannot properly do these things.

And I would agree to that. Central govt wants non BJP states to fail because they are assholes. But then that's all Delhi Govt should be talking about. Not these bs strategies that is playing into their hands.

/rantoverandout",2020-06-08 16:43:25,"['All of this sounds great in an ideal world, but this is not some utopian version of India. \n\nFirst of all, ALL states are reluctant to share resources rn, and are even trying washing their hands off the people who belong to other states (see the whole migrant problem). No state is gonna send their doctors, kits etc. Expecting this is foolish. \n\nAlso, while *increasing beds & testing* sounds great in words, but actual implementation takes time. You could have all the kits in the world, but a single technician can only conduct so many tests. Also, it isn‚Äôt easy to convert hotels, gymnasiums etc for medical use. Lot of supporting infrastructure, staff and resources are needed. All of these can only be slowly amped up. \n\nRegarding the Delhi hospital reservation, I partially support it. I think a majority (like 2/3rds) should be for Delhi residents. The fact is that these hospitals are funded by the taxes paid by Delhi residents, not all of India. Why should people of Delhi suffer just because people from UP, Maha etc are morons and kept voting in politicians who didn‚Äôt invest in the medical infrastructure in their own state?

My query -

a) From online reviews, the former two are said to have better build quality and are supposed to run for a long time without needing much maintenance but their after-sales services are not really top-notch in Tier 2 cities. I have personally not experienced their services. Whereas, LG has a really good service network in my city, though they are a little expensive. So which one should I go for? I am leaning towards LG. 

b) There are too many variants from LG - KS-Q18ENZA, KS-Q18YNZA, KS-Q18HNZD, KS-Q18SNZD, LS-Q18YNZA, LS-Q18ANZA. From a lot of research, I found out that maybe LS models are 2020 versions and have 4-way swing whereas KS models are 2019 versions but nothing else. Do all YNZA, ENZA, HNZD, SNZD have same features and I should go for the cheapest available? 

c) I have a 7-year-old Voltas 2ton 3Star AC which consumes almost 2.5 units per hour in my current bedroom (10x10 room) \[I know its an overkill but I can't just go out and buy an AC everytime I shift homes\].

gkhpz3,Much needed agriculture reforms announced,"Third Tranche of stimulus package bring much needed reforms in agriculture sector. Govt didn't let go this crisis to go waste and bring one of the biggest reform till 1991 in agriculture sector.
There are 11 Major announcement in this tranche but three of them stand out and will act as game changers

1.Propose amendment to Essential Commodities Act to enable better price realisation for farmers

2. A central law will be formulated to provide (a) Adequate choices to sell produce at attractive price, (b) Barrier free inter-state trade, and (c) Framework for e-trading of agriculture produce. 
{Currently interstate transportation and selling in not allowed by farmer middle man in Mandi are needed for interstate transportation. Also unified platforms will help farmers get better prices and eliminate the middle man.)

3. Ammendment in contract farming laws to helps farmer's deal better with processors, aggregators, large retailers, exporters etc. in more open manner
( Earlier these parties required license to aquire from farmer this help farmers directly sell to manufacturer)

Finally the 50% of population which generally remained unattended has got it due attention that it needed.
These reforms may not seems as direct but as long and medium term reforms they are great much better than 
Loan waivers

[e-NAM national agricultural markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-NAM) unvieled in 2017\n\nIn my understanding, it is absolutely the same. The measures announced are almost identical to laws already in place. These laws haven't been passed as 1) Agriculture is a state subject; 2)State govts don't adopt these as it erodes the hegemony of village strongmen who have stakes in the govt. \n\nAnd some of these 'model laws' have been passed as far back as 2003. \n\nWould be glad to be proven wrong on this. I really hope the farm sector is revived but I can't see how anything new has been done."", 'Good.

With this reform it enables farmer would be able to get better price of its produce. \n\nTake a example of  alphanso that grow in Ratnagiri. Famers now only can sell them to middle them. Farmers aren't allowed to transport and sell them interstate. So, in Ratnagiri price of Alphanso would be low but farmers could make real buck if he is allowed to sell same Alphanso in say Delhi.\nIt like said in 3rd link in 1991 India becomes globalised but farming stayed regionalised.\n\nEliminating the middle man, power to directly sell to companies and improvements in contract farming make  it very effective"", 'I\'ll admit I\'ve not been watching the news on television so I don\'t know what was it advertised as but to me it seems to fit in line with \'stimulus package\'.

They should be able to directly sell farm produce to any private entity or food processing company from farm-gates and registered warehouses without the licensing mechanism of registered mandis (agri markets) currently run under the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act.

(Pollen,particulates, some gas molecules etc)*\n\n*Mostly usage of wet clothes is a general procedure (a basic- crude method) during toxic accidents.*\n\n*Smoke is a complex of particulate matter, invisible combustion gases & vapors suspended in the fire atmosphere. Carbon monoxide & hydrogen cyanide are the principal toxic combustion gases.*\n\n*Carbon monoxide combines with the hemoglobin in blood and interferes with the oxygen supply to tissues while Hydrogen cyanide inhibits oxygen utilization at the cellular level.*\n\n*Irritant gases, such as hydrogen chloride and acrolein, are generated from burning wire insulation.*\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Cloth held over the nose and mouth will provide protection from smoke particulates;*\n\n*If the cloth is wet, it will also absorb most of the water-soluble gases (i.e., like hydrogen cyanide & hydrogen chloride).*\n\n*This is why some suggest using a moist cloth on nose during fire to eliminate smoke and some gases like Carbon monoxide. CO has a solubility of 27.6 mg/L at 25 degree C. Also it is reactive to water. So using a moist cloth is better compared to a dry veil during a fire. (It also increases moisture)*\n\n***Though some will oppose usage of wet cloth during a fire as it also cause respiration to be more strenuous. But, compared to a dry cloth, a wet one can obscure more gases.***\n\nThe effectiveness of a wet cloth over your mouth and nose is limited, yet it is still recommended in some cases:\n\n>*‚ÄúAccording to the fire safety guidebook ""Get Out Alive"", which is endorsed by the U.S. Fire Administration, the recommended and almost universally endorsed method of filtering smoke during a fire is to place a wet cloth over the nose and mouth before escaping. The wet cloth absorbs some of the smoke particles and filters noxious substances in the smoke, thereby reducing smoke inhalation. While the use of a wet cloth will not eliminate smoke inhalation, its purpose is to reduce smoke inhalation for a sufficient amount of time to escape the smoky condition. The more time that is available to the person to escape before being overcome by smoke, the greater the likelihood of survival.‚Äù*\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Now, Styrene is practically insoluble in water. So the solubility won\'t play much role here.  May be the molecular density has some role. The Styrene is a dense molecule compared to the water film in a moist cloth. So, there might be some level of filtration (solubility is 0.03% at 20 deg C) but not effective.*\n\n*It was seen that* [*they used water mists to displace the Styrene*](https://twitter.com/GVMC_OFFICIAL/status/1258266794386587648/photo/1) *molecules from air. So, it may be ""more efficient"" to use a moist cloth than covering using a simple dry cloth.

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India‚Äôs largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI‚Äôs self regulation code poses to people‚Äôs right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (‚ÄúDCCC‚Äù). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (‚ÄúBCCC‚Äù) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India‚Äôs TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI‚Äôs self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public‚Äôs right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India‚Äôs online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India‚Äôs fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI‚Äôs self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI‚Äôs self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people‚Äôs freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

el940z,President's rule in Delhi,"Hey,

Was just reading the Constitution because I was worried that BJP is ramping up violence to have an excuse for president's rule and postpone elections. It seems bad. Generally, the president's rule is imposed on a state under Article 356. There is a higher threshold written in 356, you have to show that the state is not being governed as per the constitution, which means concrete reasons have to be given. However, Article 239AB deals with Prez rule in Delhi. Here the threshold is much lower. LG can just say that prez rule is required for proper administration in Delhi.

The other thing is, there is a lot of case law on 356, which gives strict rules and guidelines on how and when president's rule can be imposed. There is no case law on 239AB because I don't think it has ever happened yet, and I am not sure if case law on 356 will apply to 239AB. In case prez rule is applied in Delhi, we may be at the court's mercy to decide on its validity. And we all have seen how that pans out.

Tl;DR It's easier to impose prez rule in Delhi, as compared to other states, and I am worried that's what is being planned to postpone elections.",2020-01-07 09:02:07,"[""It's not out of the realm of possibility.

edqus8,Indian Judiciary including SUPREME COURT is seriously COMPROMISED and is working at the behest of the BJP. We should all be WORRIED.,"‚Äú**Once** is **happenstance**. **Twice** is a coincidence. Three times is enemy action‚Äù

It is surprising many are not talking about this big elephant in the room. CAA is not just the only problem to deal with. INDIAN JUDICIARY is making a mockery of the constitution. I am listing some of the judgments that I could remember. Please add more in the comments.

1). SOHRABUDDIN CASE

Ex-CJI  Sathasivam who exonerated Amit Shah on his last working day was appointed as governor of Kerala!

 [https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/09/03/whats-all-the-fuss-about-p-sathasivam/](https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/09/03/whats-all-the-fuss-about-p-sathasivam/) 

[https://www.outlookindia.com/poll/story/the-ex-cji-as-governor/54](https://www.outlookindia.com/poll/story/the-ex-cji-as-governor/54)

2). SAHARA BIRLA DAIRIES

This case directly implicates MODI and many senior leaders of Congress and BJP. In a matured democracy, Modi could have been impeached by now just on this case.

[https://thewire.in/law/modi-birla-sahara-khehar-kalikho-pul](https://thewire.in/law/modi-birla-sahara-khehar-kalikho-pul)

3). DELHI-LG ISSUE

The center-state issue falls under the original jurisdiction of the supreme court. They took 4 years to pass the judgment and it's half baked.

4). RAFALE Deal

Another open and shut case sidelined by lords. Another time Modi could have been impeached if we are even pretending to be a democracy.

5). RAM MANDIR case.

What was that?

6). JUSTICE LOYA DEATH

Events surrounding this case warrants a thorough probe considering Amit Shah's criminal record but Lords overruled yet again.

7). KASHMIR

Not just about 370 but which other judiciaries in a democratic world allow this govt actions in Kashmir. They literally turned a State into Union Territory overnight without a whimper of disapproval from SC. And they kept on blocking petitions!

8). SANJIV BHAT

Gujrat IPS Officer, a whistleblower of the 2002 riots. Not a fan of his twitter persona but I admire this guy guts. He was jailed for life, apparently, for torturing a man to death. This is a 2-decade old case. First time in the history of Independent India an IPS officer was sent to jail for such a case. My hunch is Saheb didn't like  Sanjiv Bhats Online activism.

cwg4jn,Looking for monitors recommendation - dual monitor setup,"x-posting from r/indiagaming  
  
1. Use case : majority for work which involves routine text editor, IDE, console use and then casual browsing. No PS or other studio apps. Light gaming.  
2. Looking at 24"" FHD panels. I love the IPS matte screen displays.  
3. Budget ~ 10-13k per monitor.  
4. Height adjustment will be a bonus.  
5. Laptop has a 1050ti card. Dunno if that can take advantage of the LG Freesync monitors I see as popular choices on Amazon (60hz vs 75hz for gaming).  
6. I am already using couple of HP monitors, borrowed from a relative. Time to get my own.  
7. Monitors I have considered so far:  
  a. Benq GW2480 : From the reviews sounds like an awesome display for dual setup (slim bezels). Doesn't offer height adjustment. Available for 10k on Amazon.  
  b. Dell P2419H : Much newer model than the Benq. Display appears to be as good as the Benq one (slim bezels too) with added bonus of height adjustment and a USB 3.0 hub. This is on the pricier side of my budget (13.5k on amazon) and is why I am considering other options.  
 c. LG IPS gaming monitors : There are 2-3 I found that seem to be wildly popular on Amazon. I feel like I can opt for Benq instead of LG if the Freesync option doesn't work for my GPU.

cks896,Best TV atm under 50k budget (50 inch mostly)?,"Ive seen some really really good reviews for VU TVs but again I am afraid of what if some problem occurs with the TV, will service be good as there is no service center in Nashik my city.

But assuming that I take the risk and buy VU anyway, my main question is how's the upscaling of this TV does the SD channels look good or ok enough to watch compared to LG, SONY and Samsung?

Is there any one who owns both  brands  Vu and SONY/LG/Samsung, hows the  upsacaling of VU compared to the other 3 brand?

&#x200B;

Also as my budget is only 50k so I am afraid that the lower end of these sony...etc tvs would  not be that great or there MUST be some major compromise to make these TV cheap that i'll regret after buying them.

TLDR :- 1.Buy entry level Samsung/sony/LG tv or High end VU premium android TV

2.Does VU upscale the SD channels as good as the other  brands or alteast watchable enough from 8 feet approx?

Also should I wait for any other TV that is going to release soon or this is a good time to buy a TV?

&#x200B;

THANK YOU

EDIT: Got the LG nanocell 49inch for 65k, man that TV is beautiful, such great picture quality, also my friend got himself VU and said the upscaling is not at all good only 4k pictures look damn good, now his parents are mad at him because the cable looks shit on it, not bragging my main concern was upsacling because this TV would mostly be used by my parents and that sweet upscaling really helps even the sd channels to look better.

Please share your experience and my requirements are good battery life, performance and good screen and budget is around 70-80k can't afford more than this and mostly i do coding and occasional gaming, if anybody has good recommendations please let me know as amazon and Flipkart both will have sale tomorrow.
In my mind i have shortlisted these 3 but not sure, if anyone of you're using this series laptop please give your review


1) Dell Inspiron 5370
2)Hp envy 13 series

bxelis,Legal notice to the Delhi Government to immediately halt CCTV installations.,"

### Highlights

* **Background:** The Delhi Government is beginning installations of about 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras putting the privacy and freedom of millions of Delhi residents at risk. Feeds from these will be made available to RWAs and Market Associations - without any safeguards!
* **Infringing privacy, threatening women's safety:** The CCTV Project is completely illegal. It has no underlying legal framework or any legal safeguards. Even the ¬†bidding has been carried out in a secretive manner and our RTI for more information on it was deftly dodged by the Government.
* **We put the Delhi Government to notice:** Today we sent a legal notice after repeatedly bringing public attention to this issue through social media. In the instance the project continues, we will examine and undertake all steps available under law to fight and defend every person's privacy!

The Delhi Government was for years, stuck in a battle with the Lieutenant Governor to install and fulfil its promise of about 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras in Delhi at the cost of 500 crore. The LG‚Äôs office had recommended the cameras be installed with the permission of the police, and drafted [**rules**](http://dceast.delhigovt.nic.in/wps/wcm/connect/b4db69004622dcdbb778b7c8da9eb17e/CCTV.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&lmod=1855201116&CACHEID=b4db69004622dcdbb778b7c8da9eb17e) governing the use of CCTVs in Delhi.

Disregarding this, on June 3, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced installation of the cameras would finally begin by June 8. This is a project which will infringe the fundamental right to privacy, is a waste of public money and worse, even can contribute to endangering women's safety. Today we were constrained to send them a legal notice to halt the project immediately. Read on for more details.

### A secretive process

For a project costing more than 500 crores and impacting the privacy of millions living and visiting Delhi, there have been no open public consultations inviting comments and suggestions on the rules governing such cameras. There has also been no cost-benefit analysis, and the entire tendering process was done without the bid documents and the scope of work being made publicly accessible.

For instance details of the project were also not provided through our RTI request and the Delhi Government incorrectly claimed that such details were already available in the public domain, when in fact, they were not (*read the* [***RTI request***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jwWPi8gApRwwmiB3mmnSqNndqVvajK0E/view?usp=sharing) *and the* [***reply here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0k0J2i2kJM9f7M2EHvu7aGTmfndvMtI/view?usp=sharing)*).* For the record the complete details were not made available on the PWD website and even the Standard Operating Procedure for thier installation and operation has not been published in a proper manner.

### Assualt on privacy

Hard fought battles of getting and implementing privacy as a fundamental right are now at risk in Delhi, where lakhs of CCTVs will now record each and every movement of citizens. According to one [**survey**](http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jhss/papers/Vol.%2023%20Issue12/Version-2/B2312020408.pdf) conducted on this issue, 210 out of 250 or 84% of the respondent students were concerned about the CCTV footage being used for stalking and personal abuse.

As per the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in the right to privacy case (*Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, (2017) 10 SCC 1*), the three core elements to gauge the legality of a privacy violation are, (a) legality; (b) legitimate state aim; and (c) proportionality. The CCTV project fails on all these three parameters. Also, for questioning Peters and doubting Thomases, several passages in the right to privacy judgement clearly hold that even information in public spaces has a privacy right attached to them.

### A voyuers dream, a stalkers paradise

A one-page note providing the Standard Operating Procedure for such cameras makes the Resident Welfare Association nominee one of the primary custodians of the footage recorded. In the absence of any safeguards, this means that your local neighbourhood committee member can access and use any recordings collected from any cameras within the neighbourhood.

It can also lead to higher crime against women and issues of moral policing given that such unhindered, unregulated and liberal access to CCTV feeds will be provided to a unrestricted number of people. This will be done without any safeguards. When we say, ""without any"", we mean **absolutely zero**.

### Putting the Delhi Government to Notice

All of these points are set out at length in a legal notice we sent today to the Hon‚Äôble Chief Minister of Delhi ([**Read the notice here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tW6CsHuIWQN7K-MLgjmlij8o-T-rSRgf/view?usp=sharing)) demanding for a halt to such installations, opening up the proposal for public consultations and the addition of adequate safeguards to protect the privacy and freedom of millions of Delhi residents. Today, we remind the Government that Orwell's 1984 is work of fiction and caution, not an instruction manual.

We would like to thank Kritika Bhardwaj, Advocate, for her legal advice on this matter.

We ourselves state privacy is not absolute however it for interference it requires, (a) a legal basis (missing); (b) a lawful purpose (missing); (c) proportionality which also involves the least restrictive measure (missing). All these are set out in detail in the notice. \n\n4. ""The author might stop using the metro and delhi roads which already have"". Classy :) This is exactly the argument which was made by the Attorney General when he disputed the fundamental right to privacy.', 'Pasting from the notice: \n\n8. The absence of legality is palpable as the governing framework for the CCTV Project appears to be a Standard Operating Procedure dated 27.08.2018  (hereinafter ‚ÄúSOP‚Äù). It has several worrying features which contravene both the stated aim of public safety as well as proportionality in meeting it. \n \na) Absence of Legality: The SOP is completely extra-legal. It does not have the force of law. It does not emerge either from legislation or an existing executive power of the Government of Delhi. Such complete lack of legality while undertaking a massive government program which infringes the right to privacy of the residents of Delhi is appalling. \n \nb) Lack of Lawful purpose: There is no mention within the SOP on the intended use or the public purpose for their installation. It does not even mention the purpose in passing and omits any language such as, ‚Äúcrime against women‚Äù, or even ‚Äúpublic safety‚Äù. These are significant omissions which make the personal information of the residents of Delhi open to indiscriminate use and profiling. Hence, it lacks a lawful purpose. \n \nc) Absence of safeguards: There is no material in public domain that speaks to any limitations or restrictions on the duration of storage of the footage, who specifically has access to the footage, under what circumstances and with whom can the footage be shared, and the rights of residents to access, rectify or seek deletion of the footage under certain circumstances.  The absence of any checks on the use of CCTVs is highly likely to result in the creation of powerful surveillance architecture that will inevitably be prone to misuse.\n\nd) Absence of any proportionality/safeguards: As mentioned in Paras 8(b) and 8(c), the SOP puts CCTV data, which qualifies as personally identifiable information to indiscriminate use since it lacks any use limitation. This is made worse since the information is not only gathered by government but is then stored, used and shared by Market Associations and Resident Welfare Associations. Such data can be put to any use by them since they are also entrusted to be the primary caretakers of the CCTV apparatus in their area. \n \ne) ‚ÄúSolutionism‚Äù creates fresh problems such as digital stalking: There are further illegalities which can be indicated however for the sake of brevity we would at this moment reserve comment and indicate that the SOP is not only deficient in terms of safeguards, it is a dangerous and irrational approach to the important issue of crime on women and public safety. It has the potential of being used the most vulnerable and those who lack power and may even be put to use for crime through digital stalking and monitoring the movement patterns especially of women in a locality. \n \n9. As per the Indian Express report by Sourav Roy Barman dated 09.04.2019, the Lieutenant Governor published a draft of the ‚ÄúDelhi Rules for Regulation of CCTV Systems in NCT of Delhi, 2018‚Äù proposed to be made under the Delhi Police Act which were opposed by the Delhi Government. While this may not provide a complete solution and we would urge for an open, transparent public consultation on the issue itself -- even such a limited legal framework is lacking at present.', 'And then complain about child pornography.

I still called him in the morning and he tells me to check if the sides (outside) were warm or not(warm means good). I checked, they were cold.

So, the companies are kind of losing the import duty money on the 32-42 inch TVs as they are keeping the price same as US since they do not want to upset that market.

a65sqh,Washington State LG visits Delhi government school,,2018-12-14 15:32:03,[]
9vhp1v,What's with the cheap TV revolution in India?,"So, all the newspapers in the last 2-3 months have been flooded with TV advertisements from all sorts of brands. So many new brands have come up, sub brands integrated under parent companies and most importantly, the prices have gone down considerably. You can get a 55"" for around 40k. Now, I understand panel quality won't probably be the best, but to the uninitiated (in the TV market) I doubt it matters. 

So, my questions are :
1) is it basically that technology for production has gotten cheaper and reliable, hence the surge in supply and dip in prices?
2) how good a business is it to outsource the panel production while focussing on branding, supply chain and marketing to keep the costs down? 
3) how different would the picture quality be on an expensive 4k LG panel vs cheap 4k panel (I understand it's just the brightness in nitts and HDR)
4) with Android TV making it's way, does the market for normal smart TVs start to fade? 
5) say a brand doesn't spend on repair shops and service centers and TV goes bust, how easy is it to repair it? Are the parts panels standard or you're stuck with a big black box?

Thanks!
",2018-11-09 05:13:31,"['My 2 paise worth of thoughts\n\n1. Yes, the technology has improved and the prices have come down\n2. I have no idea\n3. Say about 80% good. The costlier ones (2L+) are probably using OLED screens while the cheaper ones are using TN-LCD screens. Assuming you are not sitting with your nose stuck to the screen, it is what I would call ""good enough""\n4. Probably yes. But don\'t expect a full-fledged android app experience. For example Mi TV has documented problems with Netflix.\n5. Quite likely, it will be cheaper to buy a new one than fix it.', '3.\tThis is of paramount importance if you‚Äôre going to watch content off Plex, or online streaming services at 1080p or 4K. \n\nWhy: shows being produced since 2017 adhere to new broadcasting standards which involve strict Rec 709 (colour range) compliance for SDR content and strict Rec 2020 compliance for HDR content. \n\nCheaper panels usually cover about 70-80% of Rec709, and can get away by doing so here since they expect most people to watch Cable TV on it anyways. \n\nThe expensive panels from someone like LG (who produces their own panels) strictly adhere to the specs and if they fall short, it‚Äôs mentioned upfront on their website (binning of panels causes this). \n\nIt comes to down to this: \n1.\twhere is your content going to come from? \n2.\tdo you care? (Can you differentiate is secondary) \n\nI do colour grading to earn my butter, extensively test monitors and TVs on a regular basis and spend a lot of time looking at pixel arrays under a not so powerful microscope. ', 'Bought a BPL TV from Amazon last August . Only used it for gaming on PS4 . There were frequent power shutdown during the last few months and now last week there is a black vertical line on the display. Maybe I should have used a voltage stabilizer. There is no BPL service centre too. Local repair guy says it will cost 2/3rd of the cost of TV to repair it and advices not to go for it. :(', ""1. I believe the silicon shortage that global electronics market was facing for the past few years has started correcting itself. Even RAM, SSD prices are going down and expected to go down further in 2019.\n2. Samsung has become the default panel provider for most LED screens worldwide, their market share is just so big now that they can play economics of scale and keep per unit profit down to a minimum.\n3. There's a lot of difference. Standard LED panels have a very limited localized illumination capacity. Think of it this way, the panel is a bed of LEDs laid out on a breadboard (??), the GPU processes the image, and the HSV (Hue, saturation, value or lightness) values are same across the image. So if you're looking at an image with a lot of white, the blacks will just not be true blacks. Compare that to an OLED display, like a phone. Every LED in it gets its part of the image separately, thus making it possible for blacks to be truly blacks for individual LEDs. Like most premium phone displays. That's why they are so much more expensive. Idk about the value proposition, but the OLED displays are much more expensive to make.\n\nIt might not matter for compressed file formats, but the difference is pretty visible with uncompressed video files.\n\n4) It's technically easier now to make smart TVs compared to regular digital TVs. For regular TVs, there is you'll have to map your UI and remote settings to your base motherboard architecture individually (essentially making your own OS to provide an interface for individual hardware parts to communicate with each other). For smart TVs, as long as all your hardware parts are controlled by android, there are enough software libraries for android to build a basic android TV UI and get a working TV ready.\n\n5) The parts are really standard these days. To be honest, one only needs to get an LED panel which is the most sophisticated part of a TV. One can possibly procure a panel themselves and power it with a rapberry pi and a couple of microcontrollers (GPU for raster processing too if you want a competent working TV, or get the Amazon fire stick which comes with its own processor). Build a casing around it and load basic open source TV libraries for android themselves.\n\nConsider this. I got a Daiwa 4k TV myself last month from PayTM. cost me around 19k with all the cashback and ICICI discounts.\n\nPretty good samsung LED panel, rubbish UI, RAM and CPU not enough to seamlessly render 4k video. But it has all the apps and can be controlled easily via my phone. You can see that they did not spend anything on the hardware apart from the display panel. But I only wanted the display. They optimized their costs like that. It's primarily powered by my desktop with which it is connected, which has a pretty powerful GPU. If you want a working TV with good UI, almost no TV company outside of the traditional players like Samsung, Sony, LG etc have a design department to do that. But amazon completes that requirement by providing UI and processing power from its fire stick itself.

I bought a refrigerator (costs 50k+) which during BBD sale, it was delivered on 11th Oct but was not working. 
I contacted LG service centre and they asked me for bill(for warranty) which I gave them, but to my surprise, the bill did not mention Model No. and price was also discounted and LG guys do not trust me that the purchase is under warranty as warranty can be given only on the basis of the invoice.

I am stuck with mammoth of a refrigerator which is not working and Flipkart can't provide me with a correct bill.

It seems like a trap by LG.

9m4e8i,Review - IFFALCON K2A 55 Inches,"Hi everyone,


It has been around a month since I got this TV and here are my views in brief.


To give you more background, my primary TV till I got this was Panasonic E6D (42 inches)¬†and I was quite satisfied with its overall quality (barring not so smart, smart features). Went for this as I wanted something bigger (55 inches). I.e. I am not expert or a geek when it comes to TVs. So take my words with a pinch of salt and if required, please¬†pose more specific questions to extract complete information.¬†


Picture quality is excellent when playing 4k videos. I have played 4k HDR videos on inbuilt YouTube and Netflix apps and I am delighted with the results. They looked stunning and comparable to high end 4k TVs (of course not OLEDs)¬†from Sony, Samsung and LG that I have come before, albeit briefly.¬†


To check, I have downloaded Black Panther 4k file (35 GB) and played it via a hard disk. No complaints here as well.¬†


Full HD channels look pretty good as well. Have mostly watched cricket via Videocon D2H and while of course, it looked inferior to 4k, it was as good as the HD channels on my 42 inches Panasonic Full HD TV. There was no blur or trail effect which I had noticed on Kodak TV at a friend's place, when playing fast paced¬†sports or action sequences.¬†


SD channels, while as expected do not look that great, it does a daily decent job keeping in mind its a 55 inches screen. Quality of SD channels is definitely better than MI TV.¬†


I have played¬†CNBC SD and HD. Whike the stutter is very evident on SD, it was fairly smooth on HD.¬†


While back light bleeding is minimal, blacks are not as dark as I would have liked. I have played back-light bleeding test video on YouTube and have posted photos of it for your reference.¬†


Also, I couldn't check reflection of tubelights, because of the placement of lights at my place. However, I did open the curtains and the main door to see the performance and it was normal when I positioned myself straight across the TV. Not that great at a side angle. Attaching pics again as you might be able to infer more than what I did.¬†


Sound quality is pretty decent, but¬†might get a sound bar in near future.¬†


Haven't done gaming yet and will update you once I get hold of PS4.¬†


Issues faced till now:


Installing Amazon Prime is very tricky. Sideloaded prime app, but it is still not working. Need to figure out a solution. Appreciate any help.¬†


Voice recognition on smart remote has stopped working for some reason. While I am not really dependent on it, will raise a complaint with Iffalcon, to check how their after sales service is. Will update you.¬†


Overall, I am satisfied with this TV and would recommend it if you want a VFM 55 inches TV.¬†


Cheers!¬†

99beos,Which TV to buy,"\*sigh

It's that time of the year when your old 42in TV starts giving bright spots, so your repair people take it away, and then in the process of repair, damage the display. They say now my expenses run to Rs 22K approximately. Of course, I'd rather buy a new one.

Requirements: 

1. Decent picture quality, great customer service. No LG. That's the current one. Customer service may be good elsewhere but here in Pune, it's now 3 years that I've battled with them. Time to battle with another customer service. 
2. Size wanted is 42in. I want to check out Samsung, but all this QLED vs OLED is damn confusing to understand.
3. Also preferably TV should last more than 3 years which...didn't happen with our LG :/

8xaktn,Ridiculously high pricing of televisions in India,"One can find a decent 55"" 4k HDR TV for something like [$597.99](https://www.walmart.com/ip/SAMSUNG-55-Class-4K-2160P-Ultra-HD-Smart-LED-TV-UN55NU7200FXZA-2018-Model/939622535) (\~Rs.41,200) in US and [AED 2,299](https://uae.souq.com/ae-en/lg-55-inch-4k-ultra-hd-led-smart-tv-55uj634v-23605872/i/#specs) (\~Rs.43,000) in UAE while a similar model would cost more than a lac in India.

Just have a look at the pricing of this Samsung Series 7 55"" 4k HDR TV:-

Flipkart price is [Rs.1,39,999](https://www.flipkart.com/samsung-series-7-138cm-55-inch-ultra-hd-4k-led-smart-tv/p/itmevhpaehbsvw4y?pid=TVSEVHPA9ZZ5FV5K&srno=s_1_2&otracker=search&lid=LSTTVSEVHPA9ZZ5FV5KRNI2NO&fm=SEARCH&iid=9ffc3458-6db3-4e0d-9abb-993ba9cbd90c.TVSEVHPA9ZZ5FV5K.SEARCH&ppt=Search%20Page&ppn=Search&ssid=cvg9bjqwmsqpr7k01531117339647&qH=b94365c3c15f23c9) and Paytm price is [Rs.1,30,300](https://paytmmall.com/samsung-139-7-cm-55-ultra-hd-smart-led-ua55mu7000klxl-CMPLXLARSAMSUNG-139-DUMM202568DE7F5BE-pdp) after factoring cashback

UAE price:  [AED 2,469](https://uae.souq.com/ae-en/samsung-55-inch-led-ultra-hd-4k-smart-tv-built-in-receiver-55mu7000-23354947/i/)  (\~Rs.46,200)

Approximately 300&#37; price rise. A similar price difference can be seen across different models and sizes.

Even our neighboring countries sell for much less:

Bangladesh price:  [TAK 89,500](https://www.bdstore24.com/products/product-details/50091/samsung-electronics-55mu7000-55-inch-4k-ultra-hd-smart-led) (\~Rs.73,600)

Pakistan price: [ PKR 1,04,000](https://homeshopping.pk/products/Samsung-55-55MU7000-UHD-4K-SMART-LED-TV-Price-in-Pakistan.html) (\~Rs. 58,900)

The  government levy an import duty of 10&#37; (for commercial purpose) plus 28&#37;  GST on televisions. Even after adding middle-man/retailer profits, it  shouldn't be as ridiculously high as the current scenario.

Xiaomi  has taken a good initiative for selling a 55"" HDR tv for Rs.45000. I  haven't seen the panel but reviews suggest its a good quality panel made  by Samsung itself. They sell the similar model in China for [CNY 2,999](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tv/news/mi-tv-4s-55-inch-launched-price-specifications-xiaomi-4k-hdr-tv-1830275)  (\~Rs.31,000). Its price (31000 + 10&#37; + 28&#37; = 43648) is justifiable  considering the import duty and GST.

Also,  if Xiaomi is able to sell a 55"" 4k HDR Samsung made panel for less than  50k, what is stopping Samsung to deliver a more sensible pricing for  its 4k HDR panels than something like Rs.1,39,999.

Note: Prices have been taken at the time of writing and are subject to change or removed.

**Edit:** Some people are mistakenly thinking that this issue restricts to only higher end 4k HDR TVs while this is simply not the case. The issue extends to entry level televisions and across all major brands like LG & Sony as well.

Add both of them together and you get your answer.\n\nThe number of people buying a TV above the Rs50k price range is very less.\n\nSo, if a seller has Rs3000 profit on a Rs30000 TV and he sells 100TVs every month, that is 3lakh profit. But, if he is selling a Rs80000 TV at a profit of Rs8000, and he is only making four sales per month, then he is only making Rs32000 profit per month.\n\nAnd, there is higher risk in stocking an expensive TV like there is a chance that it will never get sold, because of the launch of a new better TV in America, and thus everyone is holding off their purchase until that one is launched here.\n\nSo, it is not worth it for the seller to do similar amount of work as the cheaper TV, but to end up making one tenth of the profit. So, he naturally increases his market margin, the distributor increases his margin and overall it becomes really expensive. They can easily do this because there are basically no competition in higher priced products in India.\n\nThis is NOT just about the TVs. It is the case with every single high end electronics in India. Try buying a high end monitor or laptop or GPU or processor or whatever and you will end up in same situation.\n\nThe only companies in India capable of breaking down this problem is Amazon and Flipkart as they can sell higher volumes, but since they themselves see that the market price is so high, they think to keep pricing near that level.\n\nSome companies which took advantage of this situation and offered awesome high end products at lower end price through these platforms are Acer with their Helios 300 laptop and Xioami with their 55 inch TV.\n\nSome other chinese companies also tried to do the same, but then the Indian janata refused to accept those products by saying ""Which idiot will buy a Rs50k tv from xyz new brand"". That is where the third problem exists. People who are buying in this price range are very brand conscious and is willing to pay significantly extra premium for a ""Sony"" or ""Samsung"".\n\nSo, these sellers find no difference in number of sales if they price their products at Rs90k or Rs120k, so why not get that extra Rs30k profit when the sales are exactly the same?\n\nThis problem doesn\'t exist for lower priced products in any category. For monitors, you get great value for money in India at Rs7k to Rs12k market which is where most people buy it. For Smartphones, there is great value for money at Rs8k to Rs15k. For TVs as well, you will find some great value at lower price points.\n\nSo, this is basically a Rich-Indian-problem^(Tm) affecting only those who want something which is better than the norm. Be happy thinking that you are fortunate enough to have this problem, while at the same time try to find a solution for this. If you are a businessman, why not try to disrupt this market?', 'Tip coming from my research when I got a 4k TV this month\n1. You\'ll never get good value for 4K TVs in India.

What the officer tried to do was 13.3&#37; + 3&#37;.\n\nBelow link is helpful [https://www.indiafilings.com/learn/igst-on-imports/](https://www.indiafilings.com/learn/igst-on-imports/)"", ""It is taxes..

You can if it helps drop the pricing of the item from 750 to 700 USD and then redo the entire calculation.\n\nIndia by comparison will find anything to be at least 88% more expensive due to taxation alone, and higher if you consider local margins and distributions.\n\nFor example, the US has 1 to 2 middle men b/w manufacturer and consumer.

It gets worse with offline retailers involved.\n\nCompanies do not use McDonald method since with goods like electronics, import actually breaks markets.

What's your thought process behind it? Why do you want a 12 lane expressway between Mumbai-Delhi-Chennai-Kolkata-Bengaluru? Just for capacity? What evidence do you have to say that a 6 or 8 lane road now isn't enough to handle our current traffic? Would you be kind enough to link me a study which says we need 12 lane expressway in India? Would you be kind enough to show me an example of a 12 lane(or more) connection between major cities from the more developed west, perhaps? That will answer my questions.\n\nI already answered why we need a 12 lane expressway.As for examples, take any developed nation and look at expressways connecting its major cities.12 lane expressways are especially needed in places where there is more truck/trailer traffic. So massive cargo-carrying trucks and smaller vehicles can move in high speed(100kph or even more,look for auto Autobahn) Forget even west, China has 50 lane massive expressway. The massive built of expressway(today largest in the world) has coincided with its insane economic development.You want studies of why we need 12 lane expressway between major cities? Just look at traffic on the small present highways.Add to that this is a country of 1.6 billion people.So more goods needs to be transported.WHich simple means we need 12 or bigger lane highways to sustain the economic development.\n\nThere are many notes/comments/reports by numerous city planners of why 6 lane highways are now too small for major cities in India.Hell even the relatively recent mumbai-pune expressway is now over the limit and causes delay/traffic leading to planners suggesting atleast 14 lane for mumbai-pune.\n\nLastly, Look for the recent Delhi-Mumbai Super Expressway being planned.See why it is being built and the benefits of such massive super expressways.\n\n"", "">LOL.  \n>  \n>Just google search the importance of expressway in a nation or its economic development.\n\nThat looks like mockery for a simple question I asked. The nitpicking you just did shows your aggressiveness towards me for asking a question I genuinely want to know the answer for.\n\nI am satisfied with your answers now, but I couldn't find the studies you're referring to when talking about the 'any developed nation' and their '12 lane highway'. I find many papers on the importance of national highway. Which I totally understand. But why WE need 12 lane highway is what I don't understand. Instead of attacking me, you could tell me what papers you're referring you, we could go our separate ways. Is our current highway network not sufficient enough to transport good and people around the country? Is there a study done on it? If yes, show me the paper. If google is what you trust so much, please google search this for me. Show me the 'any developed nation' with the 12 lane highway networks you talk about.\n\nHighways and roads in general are build according to the demand. There is a reason why the road in front of my house only has 2 lanes instead of 50 or 100. Because there isn't much traffic to justify building a massive road. And space comes at a premium. The interchanges for larger capacity roads take up HUGE space. And then roads coming out the interchanges needs to handle the same capacity which means wider higher capacity roads inside the city. Where space is a premium. I under that if our current national highway network isn't capable of handling the traffic, then we need to increase the capacity of our NH. But you've failed to link me the paper which claims our current NH system isn't sufficient. But just making a huge highway doesn't magically solve our problems. Making larger highways also increase the cost per km. If we have a problem, then its worth spending the money. But I don't see a problem and hence it for me, it is not an issue that we need to address. But, as I said earlier, if there is a problem with the capacity of the current roads, do link me a study which claims that. All you've done so far is just claim.\n\nThen again, why should I believe you when you say that a 12 lane highway will magically solve our economic problems? Do you have the relevant qualifications to claim that? If you don't, what paper is backing you up on that? Does a paper exist which claims 50 lanes in China has does its job properly? Does that paper come from a valid source or a biased source? Is that highway build of economic reasons or strategic reasons? Is the entire stretch of the highway 50 lanes or is just the part in the intercity is 50 lanes? Does India have enough traffic between the major cities to warrant a 12 lane highway or the current 6/8 lane highway doing its job properly? Do you think the government can fart magic dust out of its ass to make a 12 lane highway or do you understand that it takes money to make wider and wider roads? Do you understand that adding higher capacity roads increase the number of vehicles on the road[(Study)](http://www.dot.ca.gov/CIP/docs/SSTIReport.pdf) [(Summary)](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/11/californias-dot-admits-that-more-roads-mean-more-traffic/415245/)?

You do understand that 12 lanes means 6+6 right? Not 12 on each side?"", 'OMFG!!\n\nIs there something seriously wrong with you???\n\n>That looks like mockery for a simple question I asked. The nitpicking you just did shows your aggressiveness towards me for asking a question I genuinely want to know the answer for.\n\nIts only a mockery if you are actually too lazy to do your own research.\n\nRest of your comments,\n\nI already provided you sources for why expressways are needed. Told you the reasoning behind the 12 lane expressway, which is direly needed in India as an intercity corridor. Such corridors connecting north-south and east-west were proposed much earlier by experts.\n\nAlso, you also need to fucking understand what an expressway is.This is why I fucking said, read at least one line about the topic you wanna debate.Rather than wanting spoon feeding for every single thing.The Expressways are not fucking used to travel in your cities.Those are used for high speed inter city, inter state transport with side roads to exit and entry. 12 lane Expressways are not built beneath your building so that you can go grocery shopping in it.I explicilty told you these are esential for transporting high capacity trucks/trailers which carry products and raw materials between cities.The expressways in cities are generally an elevated corridor or a road in the periperals of the city connecting the extremes of cities.\n\nLastly to your insanely stupid question of the need for data that India has traffic problems due to insufficient road infrastructure is mostly laughable.I mean seriously? You think the roads in India is enough??\n\n>Does India have enough traffic between the major cities to warrant a 12 lane highway or the current 6/8 lane highway doing its job properly?\n\nThis just proofs without any doubt that you have no fucking idea of what you are talking about.You think there is no movement of people from inter-city?Or people moving from intercity is very low, so no need for bigger roads?\n\nJust google search this,\n\n""economic development and road infrastructure""\n\nAnd click on any fucking link and find your answers.Is this much spoon feeding enough? can you atleast do this???\n\n\nPS:Learn the difference between a scientific paper and a report. Scientific papers are theories and various data and proof supporting it.A report is the actual data supported by metrics.When it comes to infrastructures, reports are submitted by the experts.The development is based on these reports. And as I said, the government is very slow in implementing the steps mentioned in the report.For example, the delhi-mumbai expressway is just starting to be built.This should have been already been operation 20 years back.', ""FFS would you mind support your damn claims of 12 lanes = Developed India? I don't want to assume. I want the data to support your claim which you haven't done yet. When you are claiming something, you are supposed to provide the proof to support your claims.

I agree with you. I A.G.R.E.E WITH YOU. You claim research is done on the fact that we need 12 lane NH. Please link me the proof to the statement or get the fuck outta here. Don't assume shit and flap around some claims you pulled out of your ass or saw in a WhatsApp group."", 'I already did, cant help if you are too fucking dumb or retarded to read the fucking links that I gave you.How lazy and useless a man can be???I even fucking providing the google search term to look on top of the direct links I provided earlier, still you are too dumb to read whats fucking written.\n\n\nYou really are one dumb uneducated idiot.

8vz49o,Delhi vs LG case judgement to be pronounced today,"In what could be a watershed day for Indian politics and proxy central control on states via governors , the Hon. Supreme court will pronounce judgement on the Delhi vs LG case today. 

The background so far : 

\- The BJP government at center tried to control Delhi's decision making by taking away powers from the democratically elected AAP government. Controls were placed on the government via hostile LG's who started exercising autocratic power based on their own interpretation of the constitution. Further when the government took these cases to courts , the LG started defining which attorneys could fight the case for Delhi government. 

\- The BJP government also took away the ACB from the Delhi government which was doing a good job curbing corruption under the AAP. The fear was that a prominent big fish was going to be fried for his role in a cricket body. 

\- popular policy decisions of Delhi governmentt were reversed by the LGs apparently under political pressure

\- In 2016, the supreme court agreed that the elected Delhi Government should have more powers but surprisingly passed the case to a constituion bench without giving any immediate relief to Delhi government. 

\- The case ran over an year with CJI Deepak Misra ensuring that he was on the bench. 

\- The judgement on this case has been reserved for over 6 months now although supreme court in its own earlier judgement has said that if judges can not write judgements fast , they should not hear cases.

8rx0db,"I am unable to makeup my mind on the AAP issue, I don't think I truly understand the issue here. Could you please help.","A little background - I am not from Delhi, I have lived there for an year though. Did not like it so I moved to Mumbai. Mumbai I like a lot. The state I am from has a negligible presence of the party AAP. I also don't have a very strong like or dislike towards any political party, I believe they are all cut from the same cloth.

My parents are civil servants of the all India services (police and administrative). They had good things to say about AAP on account of their policies which have affected the electricity pricing, the changes in the management of hospitals etc. After the slapping of the CS incident though, they seem to have had a very strong reaction to the party and the party leader. I have discussed this issue with them and I can understand their bias on the issue. They think he is trying to be in the news at any cost to stay relevant, and he is using the members of the civil service as an instrument to further his political motives. I understand their anger, for it is a reality they could face some day. Personally I can't imagine what my state of mind would be if any politician assaults my parents. 

My folks have worked under different political parties and coalition governments and have told me that they have never faced this issue in the three decades of work they have done. Working with politicians is not always easy, you have to listen to them whilst working under the restraints your job and service rules that have been set for you, however, never in their career has a politicians never crossed the line.

I don't want to debate whether this happened or not. I just want to know why can't this be resolved. 

Delhi although a state is actually a heavily populated municipality. If one removes the NCR region, Delhi is comparable in size to Greater Mumbai. The population of Delhi is also less than Greater Mumbai. So technically the management of such a small state should not be a huge problem. 

Here are the things I want to know:

1. Why is Delhi always on the brink of a constitutional crisis? AAP seeks to bring about changes why can't they do that without disturbing the status quo? 
2. How were the previous governments functioning? Were they really doing such a bad job? I was of the opinion that Sheila Dixit was a well liked figure in Delhi, who delivered on most fronts. 
3. What objectives would removing the LG achieve? Also is his presence all bad? 
4. Why doesn't the Chief Minister talk to the IAS lobby directly? The entire theatre while entertaining to a non-Delhi resident really seems like an easy fix. He seems to have withdrawn his strike following the press conference by the IAS lobby. Why does he not directly talk to them. 

I understand that there are a lot of supporters of AAP here. I am not looking to offend anyone just wanted to have a better understanding on this issue.

This meant AAP govt. lost all control over the civil services (all departments) which wasn't the case with the previous Delhi governments.\n\nThis is the root cause of current confrontation.

There would be better ways of having your point put across. I get you love the AAP Party but insulting someone's parents like this isn't nice. My parents worked very hard to clear an exam most people desperately try to get into. They have worked in places you might have never heard of leaving their kids alone, in conditions which were at times threatening to their lives just for maintaining law and order or solving communal issues.  \n\nWhile some civil servants do cowtow to political parties; I can say with a lot of confidence most don't. The average career span of a civil servant is approximately three and a half decades. No political party has and will ever be in power for that long. I may have been incredibly lucky but my parents and most of their batchmates treat all politicians the same. So maybe this is a bias you have but you should really try and have a holistic understanding of the issue before forming such a strong opinion on something. \n\nI am not sure of Sheila Dixit. but from the understanding I had with the little law I know on the subject matter, I knew that the civil servants are all under the LG in a UT. Since Delhi functions as a UT and the LG is the head of the government in Delhi (this I believe the SC has reiterated in the ongoing case by AAP) the civil servants all report to the LG. The Delhi Police doesn't work under the Delhi govt but under the Central Govt. The IAS officers are kind of loaned to the Delhi Govt, so while they technically work for the Delhi govt, their master for all constitutional purposes is the LG. This may have been the status during Sheila Dixit as well. The notification merely reiterated the power granted to the LG under the constitution. A ministry cannot through a notice expand or curtail the powers of a post created by the Constitution. This would require an amendment to the constitution.  I would read up more on this, but this has been my legal understanding on the subject matter. There is an ongoing case in the SC which would look into the status of the statehood of Delhi. Things would accordingly change once the final verdict is out. \n\nAshok Khemka is a different matter all together  (I may be wrong I have not read up a lot about him) from what I know he has been transferred a lot, that may be an inconvenience but that is a part and parcel of the job. Civil servants under the service rules cannot speak to the press on certain matters. They also cannot criticise the government, which if you saw the press conference was followed to the T by the civil servants. They walked a very think line and completely avoided tarnishing the image of the govt. Tansfers happen and at times you get stuck in postings which no one wants. He was not assaulted if I remember correctly. Rajendra Prasad was to my recollection caught by the CBI in a corruption case, why would they rally behind such a person? VK Bansal - another guy with wealth not proportionate to his income, he had some crores of money. As for suicide, I don't know if I have an opinion on this. \n\n2. You may have not met the Chief Secretary of a state but I have. They are the brightest civil servants one can ever meet. I had written this on another comment, but a CS is the first civil servant of a state.  He has upwards of forty years of work experience to back his claim to the position. I think a person who has served the government diligently deserves the benefit of the doubt. Also the matter is subjudice and I think the police was examining the CCTV footage and questioning Kejriwal and Kejriwal's aides who were present on the premises. This is the information I last read three or four days back in the newspaper. I don't know if you know anything the police does not, but I would wait for this to play out before taking sides. I just think that everyone should be given the benefit of doubt. \n\n3. I think you did not read my entire question. I am pretty sure what is happening in Delhi has not happened in the history of this country till date. My father has worked with some really disgusting elected representatives and like I said they don't cross a line. It is this precedent that Delhi is setting for the rest of the country that bothers me. Otherwise I don't really care about its internal muck. Also didn't the IAS association clarify that they have not boycotted any meetings. Civil servants cannot protest, it is against their service rules. If this is happening the AAP government can move to the courts to have them dismissed from service. If this is such a severe problem I am sure they would take legal action against the bureaucracy soon. \n\nI don't think you were blunt, just be careful to not be rude. I am sure you wouldn't like if some unknown person unnecessarily insults your parents to have his point appreciated. I had mentioned in my post that I just wanted to have a well rounded opinion on the topic. I initially though of ignoring your comment but was so pissed off reading that parents part.

So it's the nexus of these private institutes, politicians and corrupt bureaucrats that want AAP to lose next elections at any cost.

Delays range from a maximum of 402 days for\nthe higher education loan guarantee scheme and a minimum of 21 days for the\napproval of the doorstep delivery of services, which saw a flurry of letters\nbetween Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and the L-G.\n\n**Read | Kejriwal cites CAG report, says L-G protecting ration mafia**\n\nThe white paper alleges that the L-G, while perusing files, doesn‚Äôt specify\ndifferences of opinion but raises objections, asks for clarifications, or\nrefers the matter to the Centre.\n\nConsider some key schemes said to be flagged in the white paper:\n\n* **Higher education scheme, 402 days delay:** A loan guarantee scheme of up to Rs 10 lakh each for students graduating from school from poorer families who can‚Äôt afford fees for higher education, where the government will act as guarantor for the loan. File was sent to L-G for approval on August 30, 2016 and L-G approved it on October 4, 2017 after a delay of 402 days.\n\n* **Minimum wage, 192 days delay:** The government identified that minimum wages in the capital weren‚Äôt enough for a family to keep up with rising prices and required living standards. On August 22, 2016, the government sent a proposal to increase minimum wage. This was sent back, citing ‚Äúserious legal infirmities‚Äù.

To ramp up healthcare facilities, the government proposed that 500 mohalla clinics be constructed in schools. File was sent to L-G on August 17, 2016.

85qxuq,Unbiased Opinion - Mi TV 4 (55 inch),"

Yesterday u/hak_i created a thread asking the owners of Mi TV 4 for their opinions. I wanted to write a detailed post but because of work could not write it yesterday. After so many comments, waiting for this post, I hope I don't disappoint you guys (username checks out)

The price of the TV is obviously the most important selling point, and please keep this in mind that this 4k 55inch TV costs only 40k. I repeat my self, please keep this in mind that this 55inch 4k HDR TV costs ONLY 40k. 


1. **Looks & Build quality** - Simply put, the TV looks phenomenal at this price point. It's impressive Mi has been able to sell something this sleek and sexy at this price point. Looks are often rightly compromised at a lower price point, but this TV looks nothing like a cheap TV. This TV sits in my living room, and my mom loves how good it looks even though she barely watches anything. I know most people like me are more interested in the specs and features rather than looks but this TV is a well-built beauty, and you cannot take that away from it.

  About the build quality, everything except the Remote feels assuring but only time will tell how long it will last. As for the remote, I don't think mine will last for more than six months, and there is no info on how/where to buy a new one. The remote feels small in my average sized hands. The buttons are solid to press with good feedback but I don't think it can handle all the drops my family will put it through.  The Jeeves executive had no idea about replacing it, and as of right now, you cannot buy a new one afaik.

2. **Display** - Again, for 40k, the LED panel is excellent. A 55-inch 4k HDR panel at this price is unheard of in India. But it is far from perfect. The blacks are 'visibly' not black but very-very-dark-blue-grey. Some people will not notice this, but for others, this can be a deal breaker. My friend's 49 Inch LG 49UJ752t have much deeper blacks but is also priced way higher. According to me, it is good enough for most people and at this price point for a 55 inch, I don't think you can get anything better. Everything else about the screen is standard and I'm no expert at this anyway. I don't think I have any other complaints and so I assume most users like me will also be satisfied.

  One thing that does come to my mind is that SD upscaling is not good. I don't know if this is a software or hardware thing and whether it can be improved with software updates. I've seen better SD upscaling by the BIG 3 brands (Samsung, LG and Sony) in showrooms. Again this may vary cable operator to operator.

  
3. **Software** - It sucks. Big time. Patchwall is shit and I hate it. Mi PR team has done a good job of selling bullshit and internet reviewers have bought it. Patchwall is absolutely crap. Sony LIV, Hungama TV, Voot and Balaji Telefilms are the pre-installed streaming options and tbh, nobody gives a shit about them. Netflix, Amazon Prime Viadeo and Youtube is what everybody wants and all of them are missing. Youtube can be sideloaded but 1440p and 2160p options are disabled for some reason. Netflix and Amazon prime video don't work as of now. Twitch works btw. 

  I recommend everyone to buy amazon firestick/Chromecast/Chinese Android TV box. Patchwall is just unintuitive and unnecessary. I'm going to buy a cheap android tv box from aliexpress (more info - r/androidtv). 

  Even though sideloading app works, I'm unable to use Kodi. It will install but not open. Many apps don't work with the remote and need a mouse. Its a total pain in the ass. Do buy a mouse.  ES file explorer is a nightmare to use with the remote. JIOTV app works fine with the mouse. Google play services cannot be installed. 

  The Sensy TV guide app does not work with my Cable operator(Hathaway) and I have no idea why. We cannot switch between apps. They will restart every time. Not sure if it is a memory or software issue. Nothing about Patchwall is worth recommending rn. 

  Miracast works but streaming from mobile is a disappointing experience.   
  



4. **Everything Else** - 

    Sound - It won't blow you away. It's good enough for daily use but I'd recommend getting a soundbar for a better experience.

  There is no 3.5mm audio jack. There are only 2 USB ports. One is USB 3.0. I think they should have given 3 ports minimum. One port is permanently used by the IR blaster(provided with TV) if you want to use one remote for the TV and cable box and the other used for Mouse because most sideloaded apps don't work with the remote. Have to remove the IR blaster every time if you wish to connect a storage device.

  
  Not sure how long the TV will last. My Sony Bravia is eight years old and its still going strong. I think my father paid more than 40k nine years ago for 32 inch SD TV, but it has served us well. But then again, even if this Mi TV survives for 4+ years, I think it is worth it.

 The back button on the remote is at the center. The home button to its left and settings button to its right. This is just weird. Home button is always at the center. Also, there is no mute button on the remote. WTF. 


  Gaming- I haven't been able to test this because I don't have a long HDMI cable to go from my room to my tv in the living room. Also, I only have a 1050ti. I've ordered a cable and once I get it, I will update this post. I did try connecting the Steam link to the TV but it was stuttering a lot in FIFA 18 because I have a shitty router and it is pretty far away from the TV. 


  I don't have any 4k content right now. I played 1080p HEVC 10bit BluRay rips by Tigole (5-6gb) and they played fine via USB HDD and over wifi. 

  
 

TL;DR - For 40k, **considering everything**, in my opinion, it is *good* TV and a *great* value for money. Patchwall sucks BTW.


EDIT - Basically, if you are planning to get Mi TV 4 (55 inch), just assume its a 'dumb' tv instead of a smart tv and buy a cheap 4k android TV box(3k-4k) or Amazon firestick. That way you will never have to use Patchwall OS ever again. Everything about the TV is very good for 40k apart from the smart features. And who knows, maybe Mi will improve the Patchwall over time with updates. Also, don't forget to take a look at Vu's 2018 lineup of android smart TVs. 

 

Feel free to ask me any questions.

In July 2003, the BKS asked farmers to not pay electricity bills and in September 2003, more than 50,000 farmers took part in a rally at Gandhinagar where the BKS leader, Prafull Senjalia criticised Modi for following ‚Äúin the footsteps of Pandit Nehru by giving more importance to industry rather than agriculture‚Äù. Three months later, the BKS was forced to vacate its state-level office in the MLAs‚Äô quarters. This movement, that was supported by Keshubhai Patel, took a dramatic turn when a senior BKS leader, Laljibhai Patel, went on a fast. On January 23, 2004, the RSS sent a team of five mediators. But the BKS leaders were so bitter that they opposed the BJP in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections and attacked the Modi government on farmers‚Äô suicides. The BKS also initiated several agitations to protest the establishment of Special Economic Zones and Special Investment Regions (SIRs), which, it argued, benefited industrialists at the expense of farmers. The organisation protested against the Mandal-Becharaji SIR arguing that the project would divert 50,880 ha of fertile land for the use of industrial concerns such as Maruti.\n\n> Today, the **BKS faces a dilemma: Remaining aloof from the kisan agitation would mean losing credibility among the farmers, but the BKS cannot overtly attack the RSS-supported BJP governments**. Can it play the role of a mediator?\n\n.\n\n> **There is a potential contradiction between the Sangh Parivar‚Äôs attempt at representing society through peasant and labour unions and Hindutva politics that relies only on some sections of society (the upper caste urban middle class) while ignoring social divisions in the name of an all-encompassing Hindu nation.**\n\n[Source](http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-return-of-kisan-politics-4719127/)\n\nRunning with the hares and hunting with the hounds starts paying lesser returns over time..', ""I know why is there hue and cry in this thread because *some* people can't stand Muslims being portrayed in good lights because there are reports available on internet that proved that all Muslims are terrorists so they should always be abused or loathed no matter what."", ""His/her age doesn't have anything to do with the point they're making.

If u are in a serious condition that you need to go to hospital, you get immediate care. I 100% guarantee you have not seen the hospitals in Canada if u are using the US political party talking points against Obamacare by comparing wait times with Canada. I have lived in Mumbai half my life and I can guarantee you that the best private hospital in India would be much much much slower and scarier than the hospitals anywhere in Canada or Sweden. You pay dearly in taxes, but you get the service. Have to wait 8 hours for fever? In a place where time is money, minimum wage is $14 an hour, you really think someone has the time to wait 8hours to see someone for a fever? Where did u pull those numbers. For a fever, you can go to any doctor that exists, and none of them charge money. An X-ray has always been Immediate, never even 1 hour wait. If you want to compare, visit hospitals across continents and see for yourself. Blood cholesterol levels? The doctor visit needs NO appointment and is immediate at any clinic as they are all free. The blood profile is taken and within the next day the result is there 100% of the time. Apart from lipid tests, people here do a whole body checkup and full blood and urine and stool check every 6 months. And it‚Äôs all free. Once after eating some B12 pills for 2 months I decided to do a blood test again. All medication is also free for ages 0-25 and 65+. Remember Medicine is not cheap like India, North America upholds the pharma patents. From ear hearing aid for grandma, to pacemakers to chemotherapy, everything is covered. And, if really, it took a hospital an unreasonable amount of time that if causes them to die, the hospital would lose millions in class action lawsuits. Make no mistake, no hospital here has compared to the top hospitals in Mumbai, and I have had relatives admitted to several, one where Amitabh was taken previously. It is uncomparable by any standards. I still don‚Äôt know where you are pulling these stats out from the US political agenda comparing Obamacare flaws. I have had friends go to hospital after a rough night of drinking so they won‚Äôt have an hangover. Immediate care at 2am on a weekend, saline and electrolytes pumped into veins, dude woke up 3.5 hours later and walked out like There was no night of drinking that\nEven happened. For all the 3 things you mentioned (idk mri), it is immediate, and next day reports for blood and X-ray. (They do say up to 48 hours for reports), but I always walk in the next day and reports are there. You know what‚Äôs even better, you can go to any hospital in the country, any doctor, and they all have your history of medications, conditions, etc, and transcripts of ur talk with all ur doctors Inthe past. If u really think that Canada has shitty healthcare, you may want to look closer and look around (not the internet) and see how many visit India from here for things like MRI or cancer. They do not, unless they want to go for Ayurveda or naturopathy. Heck, look at the number of people who can even fly to US private hospitals from here if it‚Äôs too much waiting. The fact is, very few ever needed to do it, and I‚Äôve never heard of it apart from political articles biased towards comparing Us healthcare with Canada. By very few, I also mean, it is usually for things that are cosmetic in nature, like cosmetic surgeries that may not even be covered in healthcare in the first place because they are optional surgeries. And So, for several of those types of things, you will see stats for people going to uS and Mexico for surgeries because they are actually cheaper and u get a free vacation included counting plane tickets and all.

According to the guidelines, levels 2 through 5 are assigned time frames ranging from 15 minutes to two hours. In short; tldr; if the condition needs immediate attention, you will have Immediate attention to the kind that can never happen. I know hospitals in India that made me see to it that.

For example, in the standard textbook model of perfect competition, equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal. Market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by buyers is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by sellers. This price is often called the competitive price or market clearing price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes, and the quantity is called ""competitive quantity"" or market clearing quantity.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28', 'Yeah..

Reread your quote that I replied to, which talked about ""months for xray, Mri, hours for fever, etc."". These things are NOT catered by ""SPECIALISTS"".\n  Average time is 1-2 Months in the world. Average time in Canada is 1.5months-3.5 months, which is above the 1-2 month average time in the Scandinavian countries, which is why Canada argues about our shit waiting for specialists compared to the western world. It does not mean that if you have a fever, cough cold, TB, malaria, anything where you need treatment NOW, you get treatment NOW. \n\nThis is NOT what you posted about the statistics. The statistics are for Specialists appointments - These appointments anywhere in the world are declared as ""non urgent, long term"". All the stuff you actually listed IS IMMEDIATE. So we cannot agree on the statistics, as they are for different things. India is one of the top choice for medical tourism because you are not thinking that Ayurveda and naturopathy has a huge foothold in India. People who have, terminal cancers, or other illnesses where there is no real cure discovered yet FLOCK to India as it is the most cheapest healthcare cost wise for such treatments. Instead of reading the headlines go through some actual stats on the people who come for medical tourism to India. You may wish to also consider that apart from the few countries with universal healthcare, countries with immense populations such as US DOES NOT have free healthcare, and thus they may be inclined to visit India because the cost of a hospital bed is not insane like $600/1500 a day that it is here. Also, you need to consider that people in neighbouring countries to India such as Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, come to india for medical tourism for specific illnesses where doctors in India have seen more cases of. Also, the rich folk from Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries may also feel that healthcare may be better in private Indian hospitals than back home, and thus they may chose to get better care at an Indian hospital. The reality is, for the things you have mentioned (xray, fever, doctor visits), and I can add even more such as blood tests, pap smears, vaccinations, emergency, anything to do with urgent care, are dealt with ASAP. The wait times are for ""SPECIALISTS"", which India sees very less use of. Case in point, outside of India, many specialist appointments are mandatory for the WHOLE COUNTRY population, such as when you cross 55, they do a colonoscopy to detect early signs of colon cancer. And this is repeated every 2-5 years for all people in the country, for free. For women, certain kinds of cancers related to them are screened in the same manner. These constant screenings which are ""NOT URGENT"" are something that a specialist does more of. For instance, my grandma visited her doctor for a general checkup. She does not need an appointment, she can go to any doctor\'s clinic in all of the country and any doctor will have all her past medical records available in any place in north america. Now, the only wait time to get a blood test done is the time she is sitting at the clinic waiting her turn to see a doctor. If she booked an appointment instead of walking in, she could have avoided waiting there also. Then the doctor asks her if she has lived in India a lot, and her age, and takes her resting heart rate/BP and temperature measurements (that is done for all doctor visits, anytime you visit). She then recommends if she wants to book an appt with a specialist for taking a look for COPD (chronic pulmonary disease), because more than the majority of the Indian population who have lived in India around the age of 50 (who lived in urban indian centres) develop small lumps in the lungs due to inhaling so many pollutants over the years. Some questions get asked and based on the answer, the doctor 1) Books appointment for specialist (THIS TAKES 2-3 MONTHS EVEN SOMETIMES because it is a long term issue, and urgent help is not needed).   2) Get some tests done to determine if help is needed (i don\'t remember if it was xray or something totally different).  3) The testing was done the next day, report comes in couple days later.  4) The appointment can get fast tracked if something was found in the preliminary testing - which was the case. 5) 3 weeks later, the specialist goes through a series of tests to check lung capacity and wear, and matched further tests the next appointment 2 weeks from then. In the next appointment, the results came to be that there is some COPD, but it is minor, and very common across the Indian demographics who lived in India for the majority of their lives in dense centres. No symptoms show, but the doctor mentioned some increased mucous/cough feeling may start to occur in 5-10 years, similar to those who smoked a decent amount (phlegm buildup), and that it is nothing to worry about.  My mother damaged her eardrum while diving swimming several years ago in India. Here, she almost forgot about it, but mentioned she could hear a bit better from one ear than other (she felt she was having trouble localizing where a sound was coming from - that hinted her to see a doctor). The doctor checks and finds that there is no pain or other symptoms, and hearing is still functional in the ear. The doctor books a specialist appointment. 2 months later, a specialist sees that there is very minor damage to the eardrum, which may cause infection if water was to seep in, or bacteria through other means several years down the road. The doctor booked an appointment in 3 months time for a new artificial eardrum, and that was the end of it.

They get taxed when they distribute dividend. A large investor gets taxed for dividends above 10 lakh and above all this now even the shareholders will get taxed when he sells.

The LTCG exemption (and STT implementation) was actually one of the very few good things about working in India. It led the way to a wide adoption of equities as an investment class. And just when it seemed like equities were finally being perceived as the major asset class as compared to gold or real estate, the government goes ahead and taxes it while still keeping STT. Heck, even Charlie Munger recently spoke about how India\'s policy of exempting LTCG was very good and that the US lawmakers should look at this model.\n\nThis tax being imposed now holds ramifications far beyond just ""extra tax"" for the government. It will bring about a behavioral change in how people invest. ULIPs and insurance-investment hybrids will be back in vogue since they are not taxable. For eg - https://imgur.com/a/nGKTy. The govt. has given an incentive to trade more rather than keep being invested.\n\nThis is a bad move as evidenced by the slide we had today. The tax resets the valuation model of the economy now.

7s5v84,It is the age of Shamelessness.,"Hypocrisy is no longer a criterion for shame. The PM says India is blooming and unemployment is a myth. Shivraj says the streets in MP are better than that of the USA. Yogi wants to teach Kerala literacy and cleanliness. 

When AAP is seen sharing good honest real work, they bring in an LG to create spokes in the wheel, and when that and daily false arrests do not stop them they think of a disqualification that will break their absolute majority. Then they can oppose, disrupt, horse trade, bribe and hinder from within. Anything to stop the work! 

Well.... when you can lie about the big national stuff, what is it to have blatant double standards with a small municipality like AAP? What is amusing is the fear that AAP has put into these corrupt politicians. 

You know, it‚Äôs the small creatures that actually kill the invincible human in the long run. Alexander was, after all, killed by the lack of a humble lemon. The gun toting toughie will be killed by the annoying sting of an invisible dengue bearing mosquito. So their fear is legit.
