1bj930x,A short guide to overcome porn addiction,"Yesterday, I found a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/s/gX5aYPRoLg) on this sub asking people about their addictions, and some of them said porn and masturbation. So, I made a short guide for those who are addicted to porn and want to overcome it.

Follow these advices. They will help to some extent.

1. Identify and eliminate all triggers (such as reels, NSFW photos, boredom, etc.)
2. Find a new healthy habbit to replace the habbit of watching porn.
3. Don't start nofap abruptly instead, wait until you're confident. Because if you start abruptly then you are keeping a track of time abstaining from porn which constantly reminds you to do it even more.
4. Instead track the time you wasted watching porn, every time you relapse. You can use an app like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technoapps.quitaddiction).
5. Gadually decrease the frequency of your masturbation and increase the time between two consecutive ""sessions"".
6. Remember that YOU WILL RELAPSE at the start but don't let that demotivate you. 
7. Every time you relapse, admit it and learn from it. Then try to find the trigger that made you relapse. Work on it and eliminate that trigger.
8. Learn about concepts like what porn do to your brain, benefits of nofap, semen retention etc
9. Find alternatives to get dopamine rush.
10. Sleep early or few hours before your actual bedtime since most of the temptations occurs at night.

I would highly recommend to watch this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJdK6X7yqEZe_uTpS-5Cj_1GwevQLbV0-&feature=shared).

These points may apply to all addictions and are based on my personal experience and should be seen as guidance, not absolute truths.

I hope this will help someone :)",2024-03-20 09:05:35,"[""Well the information is good but I just wanted to ask if you are a certified doctor or something?

So now whenever i feel like fapping, i just look upon this clock running on my home screen and think that if i do it, i will have to restart it and it helps me control the urge.
