When we move from, say, 5nm to 3nm transistors, we are ""just"" making them smaller. However, when we go from FinFET to GAA, we are fundamentally changing how the transistors are designed. Intel and TSMC are expected to start using GAA in the coming years, but it seems like Samsung is the first one to do it.\n\n\n\nThe last time we had this type of design change was in 2011 when Intel launched their ""3D transistors.""\n\n\n\nIt\'s hard to explain how FinFET and GAA transistors differ without showing pictures, so I recommend you Google it if you want more info, but I\'ll try my best. In essence, the ""gate"" on a transistor is the part that controls when electricity can flow through it. The GHz we see on processors is basically how quickly the gate can turn the current on and off.\n\n\n\nI have a few pictures here from ASML, and the key points to remember are that the green part is what I\'ll call the channel, and the red part is the gate.\n\n\n\n[With a ""planar"" transistor](https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/asmlnetherlaaea-asmlcom-prd-5369/media/project/asmlcom/asmlcom/asml/images/news/stories/2022/transistor/asml_what-is-a-gate-all-around-transistor_planar-transistor-new.jpg?mw=1200) (the pre-2011 type), the gate was located on top of the channel where electricity flowed through. This meant that the channel was quite wide and took up a lot of space.\n\n[With a FinFET (aka 3D transistors)](https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/asmlnetherlaaea-asmlcom-prd-5369/media/project/asmlcom/asmlcom/asml/images/news/stories/2022/transistor/asml_what-is-a-gate-all-around-transistor_finfet-transistor-new.jpg?mw=1200), we took the entire channel and then flipped it vertically so that it was standing on its edge. Basically, instead of the channel lying flat like on a floor, it now sticks up like a shark fin and the gate can wrap around the fin on three sides. This allowed us to pack things tighter.\n\n[With a GAA (Gate-All-Around) transistor](https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/asmlnetherlaaea-asmlcom-prd-5369/media/project/asmlcom/asmlcom/asml/images/news/stories/2022/transistor/asml_what-is-a-gate-all-around-transistor_gaa-transistor-new.jpg?mw=1200), we replace the ""shark fin"" with several nanosheets that go through the gate. This means the gate now fully wraps around the entire channel. Instead of just making contact on three sides (the top and the two wide sides), it now has contacts on all four sides of the sheet that goes through the gate.\n\n\n\nThe effects we hope to achieve are better control over the transistors, which in turn should result in continued shrinking of transistor size (packing more into the same area), less leakage (which means better efficiency), and potentially higher switching speeds (which means higher GHz and thus more performance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of samsung 3nm superiority \n Exynos w1000 got 317% perfomance uplift over w930 due to GAa', ""Software bugs Actually differ from phone to phone \n\nLet me give you an example of what you are currently doing \n\nFor example there are 20 phones , all are same model and same batch\n\nAnd there are 20 people who are given these phones to use \n\n\nPerson A experienced 3 temporary bugs \nA video recording , overprocessing of hdr and \nA crashing of certain apps \n\nWhile person B to T didn't experience this issues because it's a temporary bug faced by few unlucky people \n\nSo the review of A was : The phone is not good and a money waste \n\n\nWhile the reveiw if B to T was quite positive : the phone takes stunning picture balances HDR etc etc and absultly great phone\n\nBut we have people who hates certain things for no reason and only use Person A 's statement to categorize the entire model in a negetive shade \n\nWhich is what you are doing because only in his video I have seen that problem \n\nAnd all the truth full and proffesional photographers praised the cameras of s24 exynos in its price segment to be one of the best \n\n>So why is it happening only on the Exynos model, the guys phone even completely froze once due to which he had to restart\n\nLike I explained a single unit experiancing software issue isnt hardware faults \nHe is just unlucky"", ""That's not what i meant.

1enssxm,55 inch TV recommendations,"I've noticed that brands like TCL and Xiaomi are offering TVs with QLED panels at lower prices this year. BBK kinda brands.. (x)

However, I'd prefer to avoid these brands due to quality concerns. I've seen multiple cases where Mi/Redmi/Xiaomi, iFalcon, HiSense etc., TVs became unusable within 2-3 years.

I'm usually inclined towards LG TVs, and I see the UR series is this year's lineup. But I'm hesitant because last year, when I compared LG's UQ series with some Samsung Crystal series and Sony X74/X75 models, the UQ series wasn't that impressive, at least in the showroom with quick glance.

So, I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I'm looking for quality, but I also have a budget, which I know is a tricky combination. I’m considering a budget of ₹50,000 to ₹60,000 INR. If there are any bank discounts or offers during the ongoing Freedom sales on e-commerce sites, that would be a amazing!

My requirements are:

* A TV with decent panel quality, good HDR capabilities, and good contrast.
* Decent upscaling performance.
* Sound quality isn't a top priority since I plan to use a soundbar, but good built-in sound would be a nice addition.

Any recommendations or advice from brands like LG, Samsung, or Sony would be much appreciated! Or if you think any other brand and can last longer etc, please add that too.

Thanks in advance!",2024-08-09 06:33:31,"[""I visited couple of showrooms and realized that LG has announced their next series, the UT series. I had a chance to compare the UR90 (they claimed it's similar to the UT, though I'm unsure how accurate that is) to a Sony Bravia S2. The S2 clearly had better contrast and color reproduction. Compared the quality using 4K HDR 60 fps content, side-by-side, at 100% brightness and VIVID mode. However, the difference wasn't huge—I'd say the S2 was about 10% to 15% better, depending on the content.\n\nThere were a few Samsung models I wanted to compare, but the store was closing, so I didn't get the chance.

1d6ekq8,Ultimate AC Buying guide 2024,"Before Buying Ac From Any Brand 


🌡️Check before buying Ac

a. 5 years PCB warranty 

b. 1 year comprehensive warranty on whole product.

c. 10 years compressor warranty and Copper coil, and coating on it. Refrigerant should be R32

If any company is not giving these 3 things, just kick that brand from your mind.

⚠️ Don't forget to Vacuum your AC while installing.Otherwise AC will not cool your room. If  technician said not required then tell him to come with vacuum machine otherwise bhaga dena.

⚠️ If voltage fluctuate in your area then I would say use good stabilizer from a repute brand.

You can use a Inverter Ac as non- inverter Ac, but you can't use non- inverter as inverter ac.

☀️Now People will suggest buying a 3 star AC 
But trust me go with 5 star model of the same 3⭐ model you choose. 

🌡️Reason to buy 5 Star 

5 ⭐ Ac is more effective than 3 ⭐ 

Compressor size is bigger in 5⭐ 

5 ⭐model has better cooling than 3 ⭐ 

It will definitely save your electricity bill.

Convertable mode will work for 30 minutes, after that Ac will run in Auto mode.

🎯 Keep 1.5-4K extra for installation in your budget. Price may vary on Brands.

🌡️Now come to the Bands 

Mitsubishi and O General are the OGs in market. Those are premium segment AC and heavy duty AC. Like Mitsubishi AC costs 90K only for indoor outdoor unit. You have to purchase copper pipe separately + installation charges. Total cost 95-100k. And it's after sales service available in few metro cities. 

1. Daikin

Pros: excellent cooling, electric consumption is less, auto clean, big outdoor unit with 100% copper

Cons: Old design 

🚨 EDIT: **I bought a Daikin 1.5ton inverter Ac on June 2024, I am really happy with it. If you have high budget go with O Genaral or Mitsubishi , otherwise only Daikin, again I am saying Daikin only.**

**And Daikin inverter ac has Convertable mode, don't believe in others misinformation**

2. Hitachi 

Pros: Excellent cooling machine specially 2 ton segment , auto clean 

🍅 Now only Hitachi giving 5 years Comprehensive Warranty . Other companies provide a 5 year warranty but are not comprehensive. PCB is a vital thing in the Inverter AC.

Cons: Consumes a little more electricity, temparature Display not available, Convertable mode unavailable technically auto Convertable so no issues.

3. Carrier

Sufficient cooling, auto clean, Convertable mode available. Overall good. Carrier is the company who invented AC.

4. Panasonic 

AC are excellent but Panasonic remote sucks, it will not response or stop working after sometimes. Wi-Fi available. 

🌡️Don't buy Lloyd, Samsung, Voltas, Godrej, Haier, IFB, Bluestar, LG, Whirlpool.

🤖 Smart Wi-Fi ( Although it's useful for tech-savvy people, may create difficulty for elders), AI features are marketing gimmick, don't fall on those trap.

🌞 Bonus tip: suppose your room size is 170 sqft. top floor, directly sunlight exposed. Generally you think a 1.5 ton AC will be more than enough. No you need a 2 ton act. You can use Ac 2 ton Ac as 1.5ton ( some models have 7 Convertable modes, but convertable mode will work for 30 minutes, after that it will continue auto mode) but you can't use a 1 ton Ac 110% efficiency. It may effect on your compressor. So it's better to buy higher Tonnage AC for some conditions.

Don't run behind Brands, check ISEER value, Actual Tonnage and Maximum Cooling capacity.

Salesman may suggest you ac but keep in mind they will suggest only that brand or model with gives them maximum margin.

🪐If you want to know perfect tonnage according to your room size, then check u/Lunaticious_  posted few weeks ago:

Buy an AC depending upon how many months the AC will be used. If it's less than 4 months then buy 3 star AC otherwise 5 star will be more efficient and you will recover the extra price of 5 star model.\n\n2. 5 star AC doesn't have better cooling than 3 star everything depends on the tonnage of the AC, some brands selling 1.5 ton 3 star models actually have 1.25 tons (a.k.a LG) while some brands have the same tonnage on both 1.5 3 star and 1.5 ton 5 star. So everything depends upon the actual tonnage ( cooling capacity on the energy label) \n\n3. You can definitely buy Llyod and LG but just check the energy labels and 1+5+10 warranty. ( 1 - comprehensive, 5- PCB, 10 Compressor).\n \nHeriarchy looks like this. \n\nPremium Heavy Duty brands - OGenral, Mitsubishi.\n\nUpper Mid range - Daikin, Panasonic, LG\n\nMid range - Carrier, Hitachi, Bluestar, \n\nBudget Brands - Voltas, Llyod, Godrej, Cruise, Whirlpool etc etc.\n\nPoints I would like to add.\n\n1. Don't fall for marketing gimmicks, just go for basics like tonnage according to room size and other factors and all the proper warranty. \n\n2.

1c1nf45,Guide to buying a perfect Air Conditioner,"This is based on my experience and extensive research.

Before buying an Air Conditioner following points need to be checked:
1. Know the size of your room.
2. How much open area is there.
3. Whether the walls of the room are exposed to direct sunlight.
4. Whether there's another floor above the room.
5. Your budget.

For starter, I'll give you a rough idea about how much cooling capacity and tonnage you need based on the the size of your room. 

1 ton = 3517 watts so based on that you can prefer these datas. If your AC has lower capacity than these values, your AC is underpowered. 

1. Upto 140 ft² — 1 ton (3500 watts)
2. Upto 200 ft² - 1.5 ton (5250 watts)
3. Upto 250 ft² - 2 ton (7000 watts)
4. Upto 320 ft² - 2.2 ton (7700 watts)

Area bigger than that needs multiple ACs as this will be more cost effective and will uniformly circulate the air. For direct sunlight and top floor rooms, consider a bigger AC than required.

Now you have to decide whether to get an inverter AC or a non-inverter one. You can save up to 15% on your electricity bill if you choose an inverter AC, but it depends on your room conditions and usage. You can only save electricity with an inverter AC if you use it for at least 10 hours every day. If your usage is only about 5 to 6 hours, consider getting a non-inverter AC. But here's the catch, there are only fewer brands which make non inverter ACs and they don't have more than 3-star ratings. So if you want to save power consumption and chosing an inverter AC, the only advice is to get a 5-star inverter AC and not 3-star inverter AC. For open areas, non-inverter ACs will be more useful but the availability is limited. 

When buying an AC, you should never solely consider the tonnage as every brand focuses on the cooling capacity. You will be misguided if you only believe in tonnage. Nearly every brand lowers it to achieve higher energy efficiency ratings, such as 5-star ratings. Companies cannot misrepresent cooling capacity in ""watts"", as this unit is used for rating purposes. 

For example, LG's 1.5-ton 3-star AC has a cooling capacity of only 4700 watts, which translates to only a 1.3-ton AC. However, they've labeled it as a 1.5-ton AC, claiming it can work for a room size of up to 180 ft², which is entirely misleading. Similarly, nearly all top brands such as LG, Samsung, Panasonic, Daikin, Voltas, etc., rate their 2-ton ACs as such even though they're only around 1.75 tons.

If ACs have very odd numbering to indicate the tonnage, then these ACs tend to have a true cooling capacity in watts. for example, I bought a panasonic 2.2 ton AC which translates to 7700 watts but the label reads as 7850 watts. Another example, Voltas 1.3 ton has 4600 watts cooling capacity and Daikin 2.02 ton has 7100 watts cooling capacity. 

This is why each individual has a different experience with their AC. Even if they have the same room size with similar exposure conditions, the cooling capacity of their ACs may differ significantly. You can never expect an LG 1.5-ton 3-star AC to cool a 280 ft² room. For that, you need at least 7100 watts of cooling capacity, not less than that. There are no true 2-ton ACs in the market except for brands like Mitsubishi and O General. So, if you buy a Samsung 2-ton AC which has only about 6000 watts of cooling capacity, and a Mitsubishi AC which has more than 7100 watts of cooling capacity, the experience will be totally different even if you have the same room size. Note that the above cooling capacity can be known by checking the ISEER rating label. 

As I said earlier, Mitsubishi and O-General brands are the only brands which don't lie about their cooling capacity. This DOESN'T mean that you should overlook other brands. If the cooling capacity is sufficient for your room size, whether you get a Mitsubishi or an LG, it will perform similar if these both ACs have the same cooling capacity at 100%. Yes Mitsubishi can cool your room much faster as it's heavy duty and the other brand might be late to achieve the temperature but after it has achieved, you will not feel any difference at all. 

Mitsubishi and O-general are heavy duty ACs which are primarily used in offices, shops and public buildings. This is why they have to be heavy duty with thick condensers and extra cooling power which also improves durability. This is why their 1.5 ton ACs which translates to true cooling capacity can accommodate the office environment. In residential homes, these ACs are not needed so you don't have to spend 50 - 60% more money into buying these ACs as these ACs are costliest. Brands like Panasonic, Daikin, LG, Samsung, Voltas and other brands can perform equally provided the cooling capacity is similar.",2024-04-11 19:11:33,"['# Discord is cool!

1bq0tmq,Which TV to get under ₹50k?,"Hi guys, first post here. So I am currently looking to buy a 4k TV with an IPS panel, can you guys please suggest which one should I go for? Size around 50-60 inches is preferable. Not sure about LED QLED and whatnot. Budget is ₹50k but slightly flexible if a better product is available for not much more.

120hz is not necessary as I wont be using it for gaming, I have a PC and monitor for that. Main use case is daily soaps, movies, web series, cricket matches, races, etc. Also would like to know whether HDR is doable/worth it at this price point.

Also would like to know whether buying TVs online is a safe and hassle free experience as we have mostly been purchasing TVs offline (we do have a Croma nearby but I feel the vfm factor is a bit low).

I searched on amazon and found the below models in my price range:

1. LG 139 cm (55 inches) 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UR7500PSC (Dark Iron Gray) 
2. Samsung 138 cm (55 inches) Crystal iSmart 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV UA55CUE60AKLXL (Black) 
3. Samsung 138 cm (55 Inches) Crystal Vision 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV UA55CUE70AKLXL (Titan Gray)

1bbgzo8,Help choose to buy SmartTV,"Hello folks, would like to get your suggestion for buying SmartTV. 

I'm looking to buy a 50"" SmartTV preferably within the range of INR 40k to 50k. Not beyond that please. 

Usage gonna be normal/minimum like watching news channel (in regional language mostly) for parents and watching OTT like Netflix, Hotstar, JioCinema, etc. for me. Not looking for any gaming or loud music/parties kinda stuff. 

Definitely looking for long life of the TV. Current TV (Toshiba 43"" LED) is not SmartTV and have lived for a very long time (~10 years now). Would love if the specific brand has a good service pre and post expiry of the warranty period too.

Have visited major shops like Croma, Reliance Digital and also local shops too. But I'm little confused in choosing between Samsung, Sony and LG now.

1. What to look for in SmartTV while buying? 
2. Android OS or Tizen OS?
3. What are advantages and disadvantages of both?
4. Any specific model for above brands you could suggest? 
5. Any other brands would be better than Samsung/Sony/LG?

I want to gift my parents a nice 4k android tv. I don't know much about TV specs. Our old tv is LG flatron plus and it's showing symptoms of ageing now. It's more than 25 years since we bought a new one so would like to hear different opinions on this . 

I did my own research but I would like to see the suggestions of TV users and experts of this community as well before buying. I was thinking about ordering one at the end of February so please let me know if there are new models releasing during that time for decision making. 

I'm not getting a wifi for now so I want a TV which supports cable connection as well. I have a laptop so hdmi option must be there. Only want a n android TV which has the best picture quality at this price range. It has to support MX player. This is very important guys. I have intention to use pendrive as well to play high quality prints in there so I don't want any lags or stutters. Dont know much about TV processors so you guys help me haha.

1alncqq,Sony OLED starts to show dead pixels along edges after 5 years of use,"hi guys,

i got this Sony KD-55A8F in December of 2018 for quite a hefty price as its a OLED tv. 

Unfortunately now there are dead pixels along the borders which can only be seen if viewed really close to the tv, not noticeable from watching distance. 

I found some threads and discussions online on how this is basically the case for many older OLED tvs, quite frustrating for the price OLED costs. Is it worth replacing the panel or just buying a new TV? 

When I bought this TV in 2018 for nearly 2L i expected to have it for a good while, but apparently OLED's lifespan is this short.If you're buying a OLED i hope you consider in this factor and do take this into consideration, linking all the threads i was looking into:

19cpruv,Things I hate which are normalized in the tech world,"1. Non-upgradeable pc/laptop. This is mainly for Apple who previously locked down users on what they can download/install in their iPhones and now with their new silicon, users can't upgrade as basic as RAM. And they're charging absurd about of money to get more ram and storage. Now, because of Apple, other companies have started to make laptops which are non-upgradable., it's not prominent as of now but that's where the direction is going.
2. Selling TVs/Monitors as HDR ready, but in actuality they barely support HDR. This is a huge problem normalized by mid-range TV mainly from Chinese brands (even LG and Samsung ding it, but their expensive models are good). They sell their TVs are HDR ready, but they have bare minimum brightness (peak and sustained) to support HDR and the majority of the time they don't even mention the brightness nits value (even LG does it).
3. Type C port. I know Type C ports nomenclature is fckd. There are different type of Type C ports ranging from Display to Thunderbolt. But my issue is, some laptops are still coming with USB A 2.0 ports, including from Dell (G15) and other brands. Why not provide Type C 2.0 at least (not recommended for a phone you purchase for almost a lakh, \*cough cough\* apple) and give USB A 3.0 ports?
4. Ads in OS. I get it why companies like Microsoft and Xiaomi push ads in their OS, but **WHY** people are fine with ads in OS irrespective of the price of  the device because you're paying for a device not getting it for free.
5. Might be hot topic for some, I don't support digital purchases as you don't own them, but I get it why it's famous and in trend, but my gripe is with the hardware you buy and companies ask you to pay subscription or can't do whatever you want with the hardware you bought. Like Canon restricts owners from using third party batteries, HP printers we all know, and companies like Tesla doesn't allow you to have CarPlay or Android Auto on the car you bought(BMW with proposed heating seat subscription and what not).

4. A ipad pro m2 which was purchased recently as a sort of indulgence to try out the form factor, take more handwritten notes on PDFs.

Hisense E7K pro- like I can spare extra money for the upgrade but that 4k 120 hz gaming modes and additional viewing modes are questionable for me to spend 10k more, I will def be not using the 4k gaming mode but I do have a acer amd laptop which might help me in 1080p amd sync gaming. So is it worth it for the upgrade.

&#x200B;

Lastly- if I'm spending on e7k pro now I have a dilemma to instead buy the LG UR7500 which I have researched to be the best overall 55"" 4k tv around 40K.

&#x200B;

Please help me narrow down on a decision - My only requirements are 55"" with good quality screen with decent to better gaming and hassle free future without screen or quality complaints for as low as I can pay for.",2023-11-10 05:22:12,"['I am using the Hi sense u7h for my ps5.

Planning to buy a TV. The difference in price between 2023 model and the 2022 model is 3k, is it worth getting the old model since the newer model is currently not available online?

Are Sony TVs still reliable and trustworthy or should I look at LG or Samsung instead?",2023-11-06 17:02:18,"[""I Just recently bought the Sony 55X75L. Sony even till date has the best picture quality. What I would suggest is that instead of buying online, try visiting offline stores such as Vijay Sales, Croma, Reliance Digital and such. The TV I bought is for somewhere 60k (after bank discount for a card I don't have) on Amazon, whereas the same TV i bought from Vijay Sales costed me 54,500 (after bank discount).\n\nEdit : It's definitely better to upgrade from the previous year's model (especially if you're considering Sony, as there are some significant changes to the picture quality this year)"", ""You can check out reviews to see if there are significant upgrades which would make the extra money worth it. Usually the difference isn't very significant. \n\nWould be helpful to see others reply as well if they have some personal anecdotes or experiences.""]"

Now due to various water damages in some previous phones thought to buy this one, had ip68 certification, also got 8-9k in exchange for oneplus 7. First few month didn’t liked navigation of iOS. But overall good experience and kind of like optimisation of iOS. Already having front and back broken screens, and their original replacements very costly, my kid throws out of from 3rd floor balcony, it had tempered glass and case so got more protection due to that. Initially I thought it will not work due to damage from this height, but it worked. Gonna use it till it last. Also shown to some shops they said your display in working condition but glass above that is broken they can fix it in 5-6k but not sure if i can trust them.

My constraints are as follows:
