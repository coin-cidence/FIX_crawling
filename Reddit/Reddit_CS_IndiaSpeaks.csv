And I have heard that argument as well that Supreme court judges should be elected by Government and not by collegium system, that right should be with elected party. Though different matters but often argument made for each of them are contrary to other.

Like if one believes rights show be with elected arm, shouldn't Delhi government have it too not the LG.
and then if argument is LG should be there so that Government is in check and doesn't become tyrranical shouldn't Supreme court remain neutral and keep constitution in check.If one is concerned about principals shouldn't one principle applied in both matters.

Cause I have heard things like ""now Delhi government can rob people freely"" and then ""supreme court doesn't follow will of people and vetoes everything"" I am quoting direct comments of people IRL and online. On basis of principal these sound exact polar opposites.

Sure selling overpriced equity to retail investors is not illegal but securing investment with those overpriced equity and then launching the newly acquired businesses into the market to raise even more capital for further future expansion while having no fundamentals to show for them other than public goodwill is what they're being accused of, basically flexing on borrowed wealth, no company in India has comparable debt to income ratios and what they now face is the consequences of their own actions."", 'What Hindenburg did is legal and Adani is bound to address concerns to investors and SEBI. \n\nIt‚Äôs not about principle of doing wrong.

104pskm,What is making you still support BJP?,"I was an ardent follower of NaMo even before I could vote! Genuinely believed a wave of difference would sweep India! For the past year, I have given up on finding excuses for every inaction of the BJP

&#x200B;

1. CAA/NRC - Do they think they can use it as another one of the election promises in 2024 when they can't even implement it with 303 seats? When will illegal Bangladeshis and Rohingyas be sent packing? When they have grandchildren??
2. Kashmiri Pandits and now Jammu Hindus - KPs are protesting for more than 200 days to get their jobs transferred to safer places in the UT, Their salaries are not being credited. On top of this, we hear the LG tell "" Killings are not based on religion in the valley"". Rubbing salts on their wounds ??
3. Protests - Ths govt lacks the political will to handle protesters- Congress-ruled state govts are so much better in this - This ultimately proves street power is greater than political power in this country? No rule of Law whatsoever and not only this the centre is giving awards to the very people who fund these agitations.
4. Waqf  Board and other encroachments - Their slowness and inaction in clearing illegal encroachments seems to be seen not only in Haldwani but also in Delhi where they sent 1 Bulldozer to demolish an illegal encroachment in Delhi. How can you believe their intent and who is stopping them from amending the law that allows the waqf board to claim any land in this country? What about the people in TN's village whose lands were taken away? Aren't they humans?
5. Bigotry in the name of being pro-Hindu - Couldn't remove temples from the clutches of govt control. In fact, ktaka govt which had made this an electoral issue has delayed it indefinitely and recent news : Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar announces 50% hike in salary of Muslim clerics, makes provision for a 5% hike every year, while our poojaris are left to commit suicide due to poverty.
6. We talk about being vishwaguru while our navy personnels are languishing in Qatar jails.
7. I come from a reserved class, but I feel like the BJP by giving more reservations in my state which aren't even needed is deepening the faultlines in the Hindu religion! BJP might have introduced EWS reservation in the centre but its own states aren't implementing it, Communist-ruled Kerala has implemented it.
8. Md Zubair who caused irreversible harm to our Freedom of expression and false international propaganda is given a clean chit by Delhi Police and guess who they report to?
9. and the news of a 6 yr old being arrested under the draconian SC/ST laws amended by our very own dear party is just plain heartbreaking, even juvenile rapists are let go easily!!

In 2018 I came to know of a large scale racket of fraudulent birth certificates and using them for criminal purposes like getting benefit of JJ Act, getting illegal immigrants Indian citizenship, getting passport and voter ids, age fraud in sports competitions, and admission in private schools. Some doctors from top private hospitals and principals and members of management of well known private schools are running this racket. I also got some strong evidence of fake birth certificates obtained through this racket being used for nursery school admission in private schools of Delhi.

Armed with the evidence and given that I firmly believed that AAP was committed to fight corruption I approached Manish Sisodia. It was difficult for me to meet him and he only gave me couple of minutes. On hearing me he said that it was good that I had dug up the evidence and that his government was quite keen to tighten the noose around the neck of the private schools. He asked me to share my complaint with his OSD. When I met his OSD he very frankly told me that the Delhi government will do nothing in this matter. But I did not believe him and told him what Manish Sisodia had told me in our meeting. The OSD told me to not take Manish Sisodia seriously as he is a politician. But thought that he was saying so because of laziness or because there was a tiff between AAP and bureaucracy at that time.

The OSD was right. My complaint was just forwarded to Directorate of Education by Manish Sisodia. The directorate did nothing on my complaint and told me that they do not have the capacity to look into fraud in private school admissions and they will not take any action because there is no economic loss that the directorate is suffering because of this fraud. I went back to Manish Sisodia and this time there was some AAP party worker Shailender who was looking at the education who talked to me. He told me that AAP has decided to stop doing negative activities like fighting corruption and focusing on positive activities like administration. He clearly told me that AAP government will not pursue my complaint and that it had no control over the directorate as it was the LG who was controlling it. I later found out that there is one Mr. Yogesh in the directorate of education who looks after the regulating of the private schools in Delhi and he is someone who is very close to the management of the private schools in Delhi. I have been told by one clerk in the directorate that Mr. Yogesh is also a channel through which AAP receives party funds from private school managements which are really bribes.

Two schools where I had found fraud are Springdales School Pusa Road and Bal Bharati School Pitampura. The school principal of Springdales school then Mrs Ameeta Mulla Wattal and a management committee member Dr. Atul Kakkar were involved in this fraud racket for birth certificates and admissions and I have mentioned about it above. There are more posts on my profile for more details. With respect to Bal Bharati Pitampura its Prinicipal Mrs Meenu Goswami is charged as an accused in FIR 41/15 of the crime branch Rohini North and the case is before the court of Ld ACMM Rohini North. This case which is the EWS quota nursery admission scam has been in thanda basta since 2015 and no action has been taken against the culprits. The court had also summoned the delhi government and directed it to do a comprehensive audit and take action against the schools where such fraud was taking place. The delhi government never did that. I also have raised this with the delhi government - Manish Sisodia and directorate of education but they are just not interested. There are details of the EWS scam and how it has been put in thanda basta in some of the posts on my profile.

In the last two years I have also seen Manish Sisodia and Arvind Kejriwal sharing the stage with management committee members and principals of the two schools named above. They have also publically praised these schools for the good work they are doing in education in Delhi and even said that these schools know much more about how to provide good quality education than the delhi government. It is evident that the delhi government are collaborating with these schools and ignoring all the fraud. It is hardly surprising that I am unable to succeed in my complaints and the private schools are boldly continuing on their path of fraud without fear of anybody. I have even been served a defamation notice by one of the doctors named in my complaint.

It is very depressing that a party which came into existence to fight corruption has not abandoned that agenda and is now itself doing and supporting corruption.",2022-08-22 07:12:03,"['Would be wild when people realise who was behind Delhi Riots, so called Farmers Riots and bad condition of Delhi.', 'ROFL.

# Top stories

1. [At least 18 reportedly killed in Myanmar by junta](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/27/asia/myanmar-un-ambassador-fired-intl-hnk/index.html)

In the bloodiest turn yet for continuing pro-democracy protests in Myanmar, the UN reported that 18 people were killed when police and military troops fired at protestors in various cities. Protests have been continuing since the military staged a coup on Feb 1, but this is the first time that they have been met with deadly force. Last week, Myanmar's ambassador to the UN condemned his own country's military for the coup and called for help to restore democracy, for which he was promptly removed from his job. The US has been strongly calling for a return to democracy, while the Quad grouping (India, Australia, Japan, and the US) has also called for it during a recent virtual meeting of foreign ministers. Neighbouring ASEAN countries and China have been mostly silent.

2. [Pope Francis to visit Iraq](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/22/968803244/pope-plans-historic-visit-to-iraq-as-its-christian-populations-dwindle)

Pope Francis, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, will be making a historic visit to Iraq on March 5, the land where the patriarch Abraham was supposedly born. The visit would be historic given that Iraq's once-sizeable Christian minority has dwindled in recent years. They were tolerated and relatively safe during the rule of Saddam Hussein, but were persecuted by Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, particularly in and around Mosul. Francis is expected to meet the country's political leadership and hold inter-faith meetings in key places associated with early Christianity in what was then Mesopotamia.

3. [Dozens of pro-democracy lawmakers charged in Hong Kong](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/28/asia/hong-kong-lawmakers-charged-nsl-intl-hnk/index.html)

China vastly expanded the application of its national security law in Hong Kong by charging 47 legislators in the city-state with ""conspiracy to commit subversion"". The specific charge is that in last year's election, these lawmakers conspired to select candidates for the ticket who would make it difficult for the executive to function by blocking application of the national security law and other legislation that Beijing wants. In other words, they conspired to win the election. The EU, US, and UK have condemned the arrest and charges, but there is little that they can do to stop Xi Jinping's absolute rule over the region.

4. [US bombs Iran-backed targets in Syria](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/27/biden-tells-congress-syria-strikes-are-consistent-with-us-right-to-self-defense.html)

US President Joe Biden continued his predecessor's legacy of targeted bombings of sites in Syria, this time in response to the Feb 15 rocket attack on Erbil Airport in Iraq, which hosts a US military base. That attack saw US military and civilian deaths and were blamed on militia groups backed and funded by Iran. The new airstrikes were in Syria against a different militia, though still backed by Iran, and the administration said that the US was exercising its right to self-defense. Interestingly, the US did not choose to bomb any sites in Iraq itself, which would have put it at odds with the Iraqi government. In theory, US forces are present in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government.

5. [US report alleged ethnic cleansing by Ethiopia in Tigray region](https://news.yahoo.com/ethiopias-war-leads-ethnic-cleansing-152657231.html)

The government of Ethiopia, led by its Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, is alleged to have engaged in systematic ethnic cleansing during a civil war in the rebel region of Tigray, in which local military forces mutinied in a bid to claim independence but were crushed by the rest of the country's military. The new report alleges that whole villages were cleared out before being wiped out by force in a bid to break up the opposition (which apparently worked). The government has denied the allegations and said that UN observers were shown the fighting area, although the observers were allegedly shown just a fifth of the war-torn region.

# Geopolitical History: The Korean Miracle

*This is the third in a four-part series on the rise of the Asian tigers of the last century: Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Feedback is welcome.*

How does a nation emerging from the ravages of colonialism and civil war build itself into a first-world nation within two generations? South Korea shows a way to do just that, but whether it was the right way or not is left to you. In 1910, following victory in the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, the Empire of Japan annexed the Joseon Kingdom of the Korean peninsula, with the intention of culturally undermining the local population and exploiting their economy. Nascent industrialization to the benefit of Japan took place, but at the end of Japanese rule in 1945, Korea was one of the poorest places in the world. And then catastrophe struck: the Americans and Soviets fought for control, turning a local communist uprising into another multi-national war. With the entry of China, both sides reached a stalemate, and Korea was effectively partitioned: North Korea had all the coal, iron ore, and fertile soil, while South Korea was left with little but low-yield agriculture. Destiny, it seemed, was sealed, with the North set to become a wealthy Communist nation and the south a poor, democratic cousin.

After the Korean War, the autocratic government of Syngman Rhee redistributed land to peasants, but otherwise achieved little but corruption. In 1960, he stepped down following widespread protests, but left only political chaos in his wake. Then in 1961, General Park Chung-hee executed a military coup and became the head of a one-party state, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction (SCNR). Chung-hee had two goals: to destroy communists by *any* means necessary, and to industrialize South Korea. For the first time in 50 years, Korea had a stable albeit totalitarian government that was focused on mechanization of farming and expanding industry. On the flip side, extrajudicial killings of alleged communists and labour unionists as well as a tight moral code on women in particular saw the South compete with its northern counterpart in repression. Chung-hee famously said, ""Democracy cannot be realized without an economic revolution."" 

Chung-hee had one economic strategy that stood out: he encouraged a handful of family-based companies (with close ties to the SCNR) to capture a monopoly in various heavy industries: LG, Samsung, and Hyundai were the biggest beneficiaries of this state largesse. The state backed these companies financially and absorbed any losses. **There were no state-owned enterprises, but it felt more like the state was owned by a few enterprises.** This certainly created jobs and made the country the world's 11th largest economy, but it also created an economic time bomb, with the government having to borrow heavily to sustain subsidies even as exports boomed. In 1997, the Asian Financial Crisis took place, which caused a massive run on the Korean economy. The country received a $57 bn bailout from the IMF, but the one-party state had come to an end in a spectacular financial bust. 

In 1998, Kim Dae-Jung, a former political prisoner once sentenced to death, became President in the country's first truly competitive democratic election. He changed the country's economic policy (with more than a nudge from the IMF), encouraging companies to compete globally and refusing to subsidizing them any further (although by this time they were so huge that they could lobby freebies out of the state anyway). At the same time, he ended political repression while seeking to make peace with North Korea, for which he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Within a decade, South Korea had reversed totalitarianism, becoming a democratic republic with strong public institutions and a first-world economy. It is often ranked as the second-most free democracy in Asia, after Japan and ahead of India. 

In an ironic twist of fate though, Dae-Jung's policy of making peace with the north came back to bite him: in 2010, North Korea sunk a South Korean warship and attacked an island disputed between the two. The South Korean government did nothing in retaliation, causing such widespread anger that in 2012, a new President was elected on a tougher, more socially conservative platform. This was Park Geun-hye, daughter of dictator Park Chung-hee. It was truly democracy, Asian style.

hrmxzq,Changes that are being made to Environment Policy makes a lot of sense and should go through. Aggrieved parties (read NGOs) are opposing it as usual,"This is a letter which is doing the rounds. But if you look at the changes being made, they make a lot of sense.

Here's the letter and a gist of why people are opposing it. Comments in bold.

&#x200B;

>ToThe Secretary,Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate ChangeGovernment of IndiaIndira Paryavaran Bhavan, Jor Bagh Road, Aliganj,New Delhi-110003  
>  
>Dear Madam/Sir,  
>  
>This is a public feedback from a concerned Indian citizen regarding the draft EIA-2020 proposed by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.  
>  
>Please find below objections/suggestions to the said draft as follows:  
>  
>In light of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide and in India, this draft has not reached many of the stakeholders, people likely to be affected by the new set of rules and people at large, due to the shutdown/lockdown in various parts of the country. Suggestion that a fresh draft be put in public domain, once the shutdown/lockdown is over and resumption of normalcy.  
>  
>2) The draft EIA 2020 undermines the orders of the National Green Tribunal which had ruled against post-facto approvals. The draft seems to be emphasising that an industrial project that does not have required clearance and has already violated environmental rules will have a right to seek approval for it as long as that project is permissible in the area\*\*.\*\* ***(This is more like removing stupid rules)***  
>  
>This is disastrous because we already have several projects that are running without EIA clearances. An example is the LG Polymer Plant in Visakhapatnam, where the styrene gas leak happened on May 7, 2020. It was revealed that the plant had been running for over two decades without clearances. ***(One can have industrial accidents in even in projects which pass all clearances)***  
>  
>A similar incident was reported on May 27, 2020, where due to poor adherence of environment norms, the natural gas of Oil India Limited in eastern Assam‚Äôs Tinsukia district had a blowout and caught fire. This caused severe damage to the livelihoods in the region rich with biodiversity. The State Pollution Board, Assam, had reported that the oil plant had been operating for over 15 years without obtaining prior consent from the board.  
>  
>Suggestion not to allow post-facto approvals to any project keeping in mind the environmental damage as well as dangers to human life and biodiversity as happened in the above cases.  
>  
>3) As per this draft, the cognizance of any violation committed by any project can only be made by the project proponent or Government Authority (Appraisal Committee/Regulatory Authority). Hoping that any violator may ‚Äòself-report‚Äô is most unlikely. Suggestion to allow general public, NGOs, media and other stakeholders to report any such violations against any project, which then could be investigated/verified by Government Authority (Appraisal Committee/Regulatory Authority) \*\*\*(\*\*\****Yes let us allow Media and NGOs to decide violations, why not)***  
>  
>4) This draft also seems to propose the weakening of the public consultation process which is and should be an important component in the environment clearance process. In the latest draft, the MoEFCC proposes to expand the list of projects that do not need to seek public consultation before they seek environment clearance. The draft says public consultation is exempted for projects including modernization of irrigation projects, all building, construction and area development projects, inland waterways, expansion or widening of national highways, all projects concerning national defence and security or involving ‚Äúother strategic considerations‚Äù as determined by the central government, all linear projects like pipelines in border areas and all the off-shore projects located beyond the 12 nautical miles. ***(Fantastic, very welcome)***  
>  
>It also holds that ‚Äúall projects concerning national defence and security or involving other strategic considerations, as determined by the central government, shall require prior-environment clearance, from the ministry without any change in the category of the project but ‚Äúno information relating to such projects shall be placed in the public domain.‚Äù  
>  
>Suggestion to include a clear definition of projects which could be classified as ‚Äústrategic‚Äù by the central government as the current draft leaves the term ‚Äústrategic‚Äù as ambiguous.  
>  
>5) The EIA notification is considered to be an important instrument for enabling environmental democracy through meaningful public participation. This participation is sought to be done through public consultation comprising two components ‚Äì a public hearing and inviting responses from those having a plausible stake in the environmental aspects of the project. The draft provides for a reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance. It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days ‚Äì compared to the current 45 days. ***(Changes to make the process move faster, great!)***  
>  
>The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA. ***(Fantastic)*** The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility.  
>  
>The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. ***(More like less time for politicians to use villagers as pawn)***  
>  
>Suggestion to increase the time period for public consultation and ensure increased reach of authentic information of EIA notification related to the project to the affected public.  
>  
>6) Another contentious point is that linear projects like pipelines and highways in border areas are exempted from the public hearing. The term ‚Äúborder area‚Äù is defined as an ‚Äúarea falling within 100 kilometres aerial distance from the line of actual control with bordering countries of India‚Äù which will end up covering a huge area in regions like northeast India, areas rich in forests and biodiversity, which could end up devastated without due diligence. (***Great Step. This is being opposed because to stop building the strategic roads and railway projects)***  
>  
>7) The earlier notification required that the project proponent submit a report every six months, showing that they are carrying out their activities as per the terms on which permission has been given. However, the new draft requires the promoter to submit a report only once every year. During this period, certain irreversible environmental, social or health consequences of the project could go unnoticed because of the extended reporting time.

hc99ai,What‚Äôs the reason behind low market share of non-Chinese smartphones in India?,"Let‚Äôs keep discussion of Indian smartphone maker companies aside. 

On a global level, there are two popular smartphone makers, Apple and Samsung. Typically in most markets these two have majority market share. 

It‚Äôs understandable that Apple‚Äôs price is too much for Indian market, not sure how much that will change with iPhone SE domestic assembly. But let‚Äôs focus on Android market in India. 

By any metric Samsung, LG phones beat Chinese phones like Oppo, Vivo, Realme, Xiomi and Huawei etc., the price for Samsung phones are little higher than Chinese but within in 10% range. 

So what‚Äôs the reason behind Indian consumer choice for picking up inferior phone than comparable quality brands like Samsung, LG etc.,?

I think main reason is these Bollywood stars and cricketers brand ambassadors and commissions to the stores.

hc48l3,how INDIA can successfully ban CHINA,"a lot of media channels have shown us visuals of people braking tv's and phones but is that enough 

# no

below is my opinion on how we can at least become a tough competitor to china and put a hole in his wallet

* Role of the government
* role of people
* role of companies
* sectors we should target

# Raw materials:-

1. buying cheaper petroleum from OPEC plus counties and buying petroleum currently or when the price is low petroleum is the most basic necessary material needed to start making anything like a cellphone body or any plastic part it is necessary we get petroleum and not make the payment in petrodollars but in INR
2. rare earth minerals,  partnerships with Australia and African counties to make an agreement where Indian mining companies will open an associate in their country and provide employment there in return for being able to  access rare earth minerals and its a benefit both ways,
3. refining of these raw materials is largely not done in India currently, we would require them to be purified in India or any other country where it is most feasible or where there are already built plants made to process these plants eg, Taiwan South Korea and Japan.

# Product manufacturing:-

* the most lucrative sector is smartphones and electronics that phrase china is the electronics store in the world holds true.

1. government has to make it lucrative for foreign brands to open manufacturing plants in India.

* most smartphone components that we can make in India or source from friendly countries are
* batteries from Samsung and LG & sony  can be currently sourced for quality batteries
* processors from companies like Exynos from Samsung and MediaTek from Taiwan
* texas instruments from America & Broadcom

# using the design from  ARM a Uk based processor architecture license firm 

ARM is the only licenser of processor design which is used in smartphones and other smart devices 

the government of India can experiment with funding a department to make processors that are compatible with other makers at least reaching 80% capacity in terms of performance or fund any Indian company who tries to make processer in India in house  

Memory 

[memory manufacturers from countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flash_memory_controller_manufacturers)

using the above list  we can choose partners and offer them land that is near a  port or away from agricultural land so that a plant can be set up  that can make memory modules being both NAND flash and storage memory and controllers 

controllers, rectifiers and other smaller electronics components like capacitors clippers should be made in India as China is the only current economical manufacturer of these components 

this will require skilled labor, engineers, and people who have had expertise in the industry and manufacturing field as economies of scale play a big factor in these parts hiring people who have had the first-hand experience in other companies should be offered jobs in India

* cameras for phones are majorly made by brands 

1. Samsung 
2. sony 
3. OmniVision (Chinese) should be not used
4. zies (luxury brand)

if these companies cameras are used they can provide good camera experience in the smartphones and tablets 

connectivity chips 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Accessories for electronics 

another market that seems appropriate is electronics accessories like:-

* cables 
* chargers 
* headphones 
* keyboard 
* mouses 
* pen drives 
* memory cards 
* powerbanks 
* cases 
* covers 
* dongles 

these products are also dominated by Chinese brands globally  we should just copy their design in these segments and also export these products as there are sold in big numbers at least for every smartphone we have a couple of pair of earphones and a power bank a lot of these Chinese brands are known for bad service if we can provide better after-sales we can get a good chunk of the market even if the price is 10-20% extra,

and I guess the easiest to target market sector as well as it requires considerably less R&D 

# the equipment used for manufacturing

* most of the manufacturing is done by robots or machines made in china 
* using these machines we cant justify any product that is made in India but used Chinese tools to  make them  
* either reverse engineering these machines to make them here or using machines from a competitor or non-Chinese brands 
* having some grants for using non-Chinese equipment has to be provided by the government   
* Chinese products have been manufactured by  state of the art factories having high efficiency and quality control resulting in yields that have fewer failure rates and thus fewer duds 
* having some quality control team that used to work in China is the most beneficial 

# branding of the products 

most Indian brands are synonymous with

1. cheap brands
2. poor build 
3. unreliable components 
4. mediocre performance
5. poor after-sales service 
6. better alternatives 

the image problem can be fixed by gorilla marketing and having a pr team that does advertising in global markets 

all the rest can be fixed by jugged and better workmanship

products should be targeted towards the starting range or entry-level or mid-tier as peoples expectations from expensive product grows more as the price increases. 

we can be white label brands as well but that seems tougher as china is the biggest white label brand hub as well

# software 

* android can be left stock and with very few modifications required for the beginning
* we have  big IT companies that have good experience building apps for big clients 

utility apps are where we need to focus most on 

an alternative to these apps are required

1. tik-tok
2. Share it 
3. miui  share
4. cam scanner 
5. PicsArt
6. currency converter 
7. video editors 

# countries we should target 

 [sort in increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita)[ order and take countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita)[ from 1500 USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita)[ to 5000 USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita) 

 exceptions will be there but we should target such counties where there is a growing emerging market that still doesn't have a lot of contenders 

usual markets 

African developing countries

 middle east 

Central Asia 

and Latin America

&#x200B;

# other sectors where we can compete with china

* automobiles 

# India has some automobile manufacturers who can make safe cars that will be able to be sold in Latin America &  African market 

they are economically cheaper than their European counterparts and for daily use 

having cars that can be used daily for 5 years  will be a good selling point  also we have to export more bikes as well  bikes are a big seller in the merging market 

&#x200B;

* raw chemicals 
* medicines 
* software (application, support, utility )  
* cloths 
* fruits 
* vegetables 

# What the government can do 

1. have PSUS  in the electronic & telecommunication  technologies department so that the brain drain is reduced so that talented individuals can help develop our country and be proud of making something in their own country and be the owner of it 
2. have more innovative ideas as china has not just copied products but is now a leader in modern and sophisticated devices we would need to invent and innovate to be on the cutting edge and be the second option but be the first option everyone considers 
3. have specific trade corridors that are away from residential areas and provide these lands at cheaper rates to lure the companies into states that have lower development or where land is still cheaper 
4. have research hubs where people can innovate on their ideas and propose it to companies 
5. provide funding to companies so that even if the loose money in the first few years they still stay competitive and not end up being owned by some foreign brands  
6. make ease of doing business be increased 
7. focus on exporting more after our internal demand has been fulfilled 
8. investment by big corporates into these startups and fdas by friendly companies or companies from countries that help India should be made easily countries like Japan and Germany and Russia should be allowed to have fdas easily as these countries have always helped us through thick and thin 

# please tell me what I have missed or where I am wrong please repost or upvote as it might end up being heard and someone from the government or big companies that we have can probably hear it 

and maybe work on it

gktnfy,Defining moment for Indian agriculture,">**There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.¬† - Lenin**

I saw a couple of posts on this in the sub, but I think the agriculture reforms that the FM announced yesterday are not getting their due appreciation/discussion/critique here. So, here I give a summary of the reforms and some relevant good quality data links.

As mentioned in one of the links:

>**I would dare say that the regulatory reform needle for Indian agriculture moved more yesterday (15 May) than it did during the last seven decades**

There are three major reforms:

* **Amendment to Essential Commodities Act** \- ECA was brought in during agri production shortage of 1950s socialist era; would be amended now to deregulate cereal, pulses, edible oils, onion, potato, etc. with no restrictions on export, stocking.
   * This means farmers and traders will be free to enter into export commitments without the fear that the government may turn the tap on or off based on domestic prices or production.
   * In simple words, say there is sudden increase in onion prices due to heavy rains and the prices of onions rise from 30->100. Now ECA kicks in and farmers have to sell at 30, not 100(though the final consumer is still paying 100). Also, they can no longer export their produce. But there is a lag period b/w the farmers being forced to sell at 30 and the price dropping back to 30 and the price diff in this lag period is pocketed by the middlemen.
   * It will also make India a reliable supplier in the agri-produce export markets. Nobody(let alone importers) like unreliability.
* **APMC Reforms** \- Central law to give farmers choice to sell, enable interstate trade, e-trade of produce.
   * Currently, Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) laws force farmers to sell only to government-licensed agents at these demarcated *mandis*, thus denying them fair prices
   * **Now think at a micro level**: a farmer may rush to the *mandi* based on a certain price expectation, but when lots of farmers arrive at the same *mandi* with their produce, the excess arrivals end up strengthening the buying power of the agents and prices crash. The farmer can, of course, take his produce back home, but this means incurring additional transport and storage costs
   * Once e-trading is allowed and deliveries can be made outside one‚Äôs own state, farmers can sell at an acceptable price and deliver wherever it is advantageous to them
* **Contract Framing -** It tackles all the problems of Indian agriculture:
   * Think from the perspective of Reliance. Reliance wants to sell potato chips. Currently it has to source the potatoes from some middleman(most probably an APMC agent) who aggregates it from some small level farmers. Now Reliance knows that it needs to sell potato chips for the next 2 years. So, instead of sourcing it form middle men, Reliance will enter into contract with a large number of small farmers to get a large area of land, provide them with best seeds, technology etc. This will deal with the problems of **lack of scale**; **lack of tech.** as now Reliance has incentive to enhance production; **crop diversification** as earlier maybe most of the contract farmers would have grown rice/wheat(as the govt. guarantees to buy these at a fixed price, no matter the amount of production); provide an implicit **insurance to the farmers** as they now know the big company has promised(legally) to pay them at least Rs x/quintal.
   * **Cut out the middleman**: allow buyers and sellers to divide that middleman‚Äôs margin between themselves, thus benefiting both producers of food and consumers

eumu5h,My case for Kejriwal and AAP,"My Case for Kejriwal

Yep, you read that right, it is not clickbait either, so read on.

Disclaimer - From the start I have been attracted by the AAP adventure, I even signed up after that stunning win they had in Delhi (the first time) and donated a lot of cash. Then started Kejriwal's endless nautanki and within months I turned into a detractor. Esp given my personal investment of time and money, the animosity I had towards him was outdone only by the animosity I hold towards the Fake Gandhis - Indira and down (that is pretty legendary though).

However AK seems very shrewd as a tactician, and unlike the hardcore demagogues we have like a Momta or any of the Southern party chiefs, open to substantial course correction. While he did overdo the whole ""Anarchist"" nonsense, he and his party seem to have settled down into actually doing issue based voting (in parliament) and not just personality, hate driven. So while many of these regional satraps opposed removal of Art 370, AAP supported it. On CAA, AK has pretty much maintained radio silence, sat out Shaheen Bhag entirely (the AAP and AK of even a half a year ago would have gone balls to the walls in this same scenario), and only recently said that everyone has a right to protest which is vague at best.

AAP seems to now decided working with centre is the way forward and gone are the protests about the LG and the threats to initiate statehood for Delhi. Broadly speaking, AK has his own vote bank but is also broadly willing to look at the bigger picture.

As to WHY Kejriwal / AAP - Fact is, we need a solid alternative to the various regional satraps and of course the Congress. AAP definitely has the right intentions of increasing funding for education and healthcare (yes, a lot of it is just propaganda but you can't expect him to fix Delhi's health and education systems in 5 years just as you can't expect Modi to fix it at a national level in 5 - if you support one and not the other on this, you are a hypocrite). They seem to put national interests ahead of parochial ones (unless even this current behaviour is false in which case...well, back to Kejriwal hating for me). Is this perfect? No but compared to the alternatives in Delhi and Punjab (for a start), at least a semblance of a vision is being articulated!

I do want AK / AAP to win Delhi and possibly Punjab in the near to mid future (even 10 seats in Punjab would be a good start), AK to continue to not be a nautanki driven clown and also get their MLA's / MP's to go  back to the people which was the origins of this project.

All this should help accelerate the diminishing of the Congressi votebank which as long as the fake Gandhis head, is pure cancer.",2020-01-27 11:41:10,"[""Doesn't AAP already have around 20 seats in Punjab?

cfxghh,Indian Leftists are trying to get the German ambassador fired because he visited Hindu temple and organizations.,"They are spreading lies that have been debunked a long time ago like that ""the RSS is a Nazi-inspired organization"".

RSS is the biggest Hindu organization in the world. Most Hindu temples in North America and Europe (excluding ISKCON and Sri Lankan Tamil Hindu temples)  has some affiliation with the RSS.

It will be a major setback for Hinduism if the Leftists win this battle and succeed in wrongly portraying the RSS as a Nazi organization and getting the German ambassador fired.

ae4b0q,Why Modi will get a second term,"With all the negativity surrounding the bjp losses in mp, chattisgarh and Rajasthan and the sense of despndency among the ""RW"", here are the reasons why you should ignore the pessimistic rumblings from armchair activists:

- Modi has been hounded by the congress + its ecosystem for the better part of two decades, so knows what they are capable of and the games that they play.

This has enabled him to consistently stay on top and beat them. I have absolutely no doubt that he has a lot of tricks up his sleeve, and by the time the elections come up, Congress isn't gonna know what hit them - could be pappu's trysts, congress' funding, more scams from the UPA era, more skeletons from the gandhi closet, white papers etc. 

- Wants to leave a legacy as the modern father of the nation. 

He wants to change the trajectory of India - economically,culturally et al and knows that's not possible with just a single term. He wants to be an ataturk or gandhi, and change the very idea of India nurtured by the congress. Such a person is playing the long game, and no way are they just looking at a poll victory or leaving things to chance. Someday, he wants to have an equally large, if not larger statue of himself similar to the Sardar. You can deduce this from his complete negation of Congress and the Gandhis contribution (lol) to India. He could have very easily coined a slogan like ""corruption/scam mukt bharat"". But no, he choose ""Congress mukt bharat"", here the idea is not just a congress-free polity, but a certain ideology-free India. An ideology that has been holding India back since independence. 

He's in effect trying to rewind to '47 and take India through an alternative route 

- You often have to take politicians claims with a pinch of salt, However, Modi's the real deal when it comes to a thirst for knowledge. Here he is talking about the fucking internet in the late '90s/early '00s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hUxuLgThAA and combine this with his actual knowledge of Islam and its gameplan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAlXH13Xafw You have to admit that the man knows its stuff. 

His adoption of SM in 2014 was another pointer to the man's mindset 

- Hillary clinton will always be the candidate who lost to trump of all people. Modi definitely doesn't want to lose to pappu and go out in that way, and watch an incompetent nincompoop destroy all that he's planned and built. He would abhor losing to a talentless ""shehzada"" that he has mocked so many times in the past. 

- He was born for politics This is a guy that's spent the better part of his life living and breathing politics. It's second nature to him and Shah. Has a pulse for India and what the people want. No doubt sharpened by his years of travelling across India and being a grassroots bjp worker when he was younger: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi#Early_life_and_education 

This has put him in good stead when fighting elections, and is the reason he's one if the most successful politicians. He has a certain connect with his TG and always sets unexpected narratives, be it Demon, GST, surgical strikes or the 10% reservation (which isn't a knee-jerk reaction to losses, but the opening gambit for 2019, because if there's one thing we know about Modi, it's that he doesn't do knee-jerk. The man is fucking patient and puts up with everything thrown at him). He's also been preoccupied with Bharat and Hindu causes since a young age and wants to set Hinduism as the default os for Bharat, hence the long-term strategy (Congress mukt Bharat) and grooming of Yogi.

- Mahathugbandhan has been in works for the last three years. Hard to imagine that modi and shah would sit by idly without a plan 

- If ousted, Modi and shah are goners and would be in jail or treated worse by UPA 3 

In summary, a lifetime of political intrigue and cunning, patriotism, lust for power, a desire for legacy, a genuine wish to see a developed Bharat, and Hinduism regaining its lost glory will make sure that Modi uses all the tricks at his disposal to win a second term - be it ordinances, war or what have you. 

Coming to the rapidly tightening noose around Raul and Sonia, Modi had earlier spelled out that he would be an administrator for the first 41/2 years, and a politician for the last few months. Well, the last few months are upon us. The first shot is the 10% reservation, which has made congress wet its pants, and driven Rafale off the radar. 

Michel in all probability is going to sing like a canary. With the OSA being a distinct possibility, things aren't looking too good for the gandhis/congress, what with Michel's involvement in the Rafale saga, as well. 

Mallya, choksi etc are in various stages of extradition. Vadra is under the scanner again, and things seem to be following a pre-determined path, gradually circling towards an end-game with none being the wiser. 

Modi's just been quietly sharpening his blades in contrast to congress's shrill antics. If all this seems like a larger-than-life movie, that's because mudi ji is just that sort of a man.

The next few months are going to be entertaining as hell. Buckle up and enjoy.

Thanks to 20&#37; import duty imposed on CBU imports to India.  
 ‚Äî-  
  Just because CBU imports to India attracts 20&#37; custom Duty- Phone  makers are forced to share their final Assembly between China /Korea to  India that‚Äôs what what Modi could do. 

Okay, then Bhakts say something is better than ‚ÄúItalian congress‚Äù

 No- India was the manufacturing hub of Moblephones in the late 90s and  early 2000s . Sri Perumpathur- in the mid 90s used to produce upto 30&#37;  of mobile Phones of the world. 

Due to this Modi‚Äôs PR ONLY VISION  - meanwhile all Indian Phone Brands has collapsed . Indian Brands which  used to import from China have become less price competitive because of  splitting their assembly lines between Shenzhen and India. The cost on  logistics and Q/C pushed their prices up and eventually they lost market  shares. 

Before Modi -In 2014 - 3of top 5selling phone brands  were Indians ( Samsung -Micromax- Karbonn- Lava- Motorola were the first  5 according to IDC import Data, ) 

Now in 2018- All Chinese  except Samsung  - Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and Transsion - which sells Itel,  Tecno and Infinix brands - making its entry in the top five smartphone  players.

‚Äî‚Äî-

And Modi couldn‚Äôt make any impact on phone business  for creating wealth or quality employment for Indians 

 The three CPU makers - Qualcomm - MediaTek- Spreadtrum are not making  anything in India ( First is American - Second is Taiwanese and third is  Chinese )

Not a single memory maker is Indian ( Samsung -Todhiba-WD- Apacer etc are the biggest ones )

Not a single LCD /Display maker is Indian( Samsung LG )

Not a single Battery maker is Indian (Panasonic, LG, BYD etc )

Not a single big handset ODM which is assembling Phones in India  is Indian ( All are Chinese or Taiwanese) 

Not even a single IDH is operating completely - without Chinese assistance - in India 

Not a single headset maker is Indian

Not a single camera -lens- sensor maker is Indian

There are mainly just 4 such companies in the world intel, TSMC, Samsung, global foundries. Of these intel and global foundries are exclusive to intel and amd chips. This pretty much leaves only TSMC and Samsung which are available for other design companies like Qualcomm and mediatek. And chip fab business is beyond bleeding edge companies. They require huge R&D, tons of capital and decades of experience to compete in the aggressive node shrink that you see in todays chips. These companies are very high risk and low profit margin companies. To give you a perspective TSMC has to spend 17 billion USD to make their new fab for 5nm in taiwan and after they have to make a fab for 3nm 2 years later. That much is amount they have spend for each node reduction. And then there is the issue of patents. Thats why even with so much profit neither apple or Qualcomm had tried to invest in bringing fabrication for their chips in house.So if you expect india with neither the infrastructure nor  talented people in this field to manufacture such chips in 4 years you are beyond delusional.""]"

It is bizarre that the most powerful Congress should decide on some of the local issues of Washington DC, which can be easily relegated to its local mayoral government. While residents of Washington DC too continue to aspire for a complete statehood, nevertheless, the police remain a state subject for them, meaning thereby, the local police are controlled by Mayor and municipality.
