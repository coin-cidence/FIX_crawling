1ez4j0m,Building a High-End Future-Proof PC Without a GPU - Waiting for RDNA 4 (8900 XT) - Need Second Opinions!,"Hey everyone,

I was originally planning to build a PC with a Ryzen 5 7600 and a 7900 XT GPU, but I decided to hold off after seeing leaks that the next-gen RDNA 4 GPUs are right around the corner (expected in 3-6 months). The leaks suggest better ray tracing performance and better value for money, so I'm thinking of waiting to buy whatever the highest-end model is when it releases—let's assume it's going to be called the 8900 XT.

# Already Purchased:

* **Motherboard**: ASRock B650M PG Lightning WiFi (AMD Socket AM5, DDR5 7200MHz)
* **SSD**: Western Digital Blue SN580 1TB M.2 NVMe Gen4
* **RAM**: G.Skill Ripjaws S5 Series 32GB (16GBx2) DDR5 6000MHz

# Planning to Buy:

* **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 7600 Gaming Desktop Processor (100-100001015BOX)
* **PSU**: DeepCool PX1000G (1000W, 80+ Gold)
* **Cabinet**: DeepCool CH560
* **Cooler**: DeepCool AK400 Black 120mm CPU Air Cooler (R-AK400-BKNNMN-G-1)
* **Monitor**: LG 27GR75Q-B (1440p 165Hz)

# Usage:

I’ll be gaming at 1440p, watching anime, and doing some coding. I already have a mouse, keyboard, and headset, so those are covered.

# Questions:

1. **Is my choice of PSU overkill, or is it a good idea to go with 1000W for future-proofing, considering the next-gen GPU (8900 XT)?**
2. **Will the DeepCool CH560 and AK400 cooler provide adequate cooling and airflow for the Ryzen 5 7600 and a high-end GPU down the line?**
3. **Is the LG 27GR75Q-B a good choice for 1440p 165Hz gaming, especially with a future high-end GPU like the 8900 XT?**
4. **Since I’m planning to buy the highest-end model AMD releases, will the parts I’ve already purchased and the ones I’m planning to buy work fine with the 8900 XT?**
5. **Should I consider upgrading the CPU to something more powerful, or is the Ryzen 5 7600 sufficient for my needs?**
6. **Any other components I should consider upgrading or adding to ensure my build is ready for the next-gen GPU?**

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions! Thanks in advance for the help.

If I or the OP or anybody else can afford the best stuff, why would I settle for less?\n\nAnd oh man, NOPE, AMD processors are actually extremely good on the other hand, especially their 3D V-Cache SKUs which smoke Intel in 1% lows on the most part. They are also highly energy efficient, and AMD offers TONS of undervolting like the amazing Curve Optimizer which can be used to undervolt each core minutely so that your best cores boost higher, and 1click smart OC tech like Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO). AMD CPUs are EXTREMELY good and VERY competent with Intel's. And heck, I'd say rn, they are better owing to Intel's microcode issue which is causing faster degradation unless you downclock the CPU and RAM and lose a decent chunk of performance.\n\nAgain, we are NOT talking mid-range AT ALL. And yeah FSR is improving, but so is DLSS? Do you think NVIDIA is waiting for them to catch up? I talked about their newest preset E, which is extremely competent and a nice compromise between preset C's still image rendering and D's motion clarity. FSR2 was oversharpened to hell and FSR3, though quite a bit better, still is nowhere close to DLSS3.\n\nYour misinformed self just keeps unravelling, goddamn.\n\nAnd lastly, you don't have to be Lisa Su or Jenson's relative to afford this stuff.

I can't play any game without it"", 'One thing I noticed, the OP of the post said High end Future proof but purchased a B650 m-ATX board and wants 7600x? Kinda oxymoronic to put high end and 7600 in the same sentence.', ""The most important areas...Price to performance and not taking consumers to be idiots.\n\nIgnoring the price (you can never ignore the price. the  fact that you have to do that for a product that is bought means you know the answer), G-sync has become redundant. Just go on Amazon and see how many G-sync vs FreeSync monitors you get. G-sync monitors are more expensive because they need a dedicated chip in them to run it. AMD deliberately chose not to do it.\n\nDLSS is undoubtedly far superior to FSR but Intel's XeSS is surprisingly good and it runs on all hardware. I don't know about you, but I have seen many such exclusive features come and go and only the open ones remain in the market. FSR is also available in all games. Nvidia had PhysX, Hairworks and now G-sync all becoming redundant and replaced by other openly used tech.\n\nGetting RTX is like the crypto boom, it had a lot of value initially (RTX 3000 series), but with every iteration, you will get less and less value and competition catches up, which means 2 years after you purchase the lastest and greatest for 1.5 - 2 lakhs, it's going to be outdone by other much much cheaper cards.\n\nMost importantly, you are comparing two products which have not released. How can you even claim to not be biased? It's bad advice...really bad advice."", 'edited it as well...and no I am not spreading misinformation.\n\nPeople buy into hype too much and all my points are really valid. just not for high end.', 'lol I got it 😅', 'Wow...a whole lot of nothing. Put up an argument or stop the bs lol.\n\nYes the price to performance is better but the commenter already said ""If you can \'afford\' the latest and greatest"". No one is talking about the price here. Good job though, you didnt refute a single fact of theirs and called them a shill, wow.', 'You\'re so utterly misinformed it\'s crazy.\n\nFirst of all, only ""G-Sync Ultimate"" certified monitors have a dedicated module in them. All monitors you see online are ""G-Sync Compatible"", which only use VESA\'s adaptive sync to enable variable refresh rates. So no, they don\'t have a ""chip"" in them. Even then, G-Sync Compatible is noticeably better for VRR because it has less ghosting.\n\nDLSS3 smokes the competition and it\'s not a question. FSR3 is far behind, and sure XeSS is good, but not good enough. Their newly released preset E is so much better in  motion clarity than both FSR and XeSS. ""surprisingly good"" doesn\'t cut it when we\'re talking best case scenarios. And where\'s the argument about NVIDIA Reflex, NVIDIA FrameGen, NVIDIA DLAA? You made zero points here?\n\nAnd comparing RT to crypto boom? Are you sure you\'re alright dude? RT is the natural evolution from baked in lighting. Game devs say so themselves and it\'s gonna be a staple for AAA titles (again, we\'re strictly talking high end PCs here).It\'s only gonna get increasingly common. We had path tracing as an option in older titles but with newest titles like Wukong, Path Tracing is the default so it\'s only gonna get more taxing on the GPU. NVIDIA does all their upscaling and RT stuff on dedicated RT cores in the GPU, whereas AMD\'s approach is a mix of software and hardware sided which I applaud them for letting everyone enjoy it, but this also means they simply cannot compete and coming ahead is out of the question.\n\nEven I can at least predict that unless a miracle happens, AMD pulling ahead in the high end GPU area is simply impossible. I also stated that I fully understand how scummy NVIDIA is with their pricing and how stingy they are with their VRAM, but the fact remains that they can exploit us because AMD is not offering any competition to them at all. So customers who buy NVIDIA or vouch for NVIDIA aren\'t shills, we\'re kinda forced to get them because the fact remains they\'re the best.\n\nPlease get your facts right before starting an argument about stuff you have no clue about.', 'Not one of the tech I talked about is just ""hype"". I even said in my very first comment that AMD makes the most sense for me in the budget segment and repeatedly made all my other arguments by prefacing them with ""talking about the high end here"" tagline.\n\nCalling me a shill when I talked about everything in expansive detail and clearly explaining why its better is just moronic.', 'lol...no wonder companies like apple and Nvidia keep fooling their customers. This is why we have to pay an arm and a leg for graphics cards these days. it has nothing to do with crypto, that has long passed and Nvidia knows people will value their gimmicks and bullshit so much.\n\nHonestly it makes me sad, but it seems it\'s how people are these days. Nvidia, Apple, they keep selling cause people want ""the latest and greatest"" not understanding a thing about value.\n\nlol. The standard G-sync is the same as freesync then...so what even is your point? That causal gamers will get that sweet -5ms ? lol...that\'s the value you get?\n\nI think we\'re getting what we deserve at this point....', 'Simple reason for it. You cannot take money and value away from a product when considering it.\n\nAnd I still stand by my assessment, you\'re making a call on unreleased products and that will always be a guess. Again, what is high end? OP specifically said he wants AMD because it is ""value for money"" and you make the discussion about ""high end, no budget"" to suit your arguments.\n\nI repeat again...OP has specifically stated that he is choosing AMD for ""value and budget"" and you chose to ignore it while I did not.\n\nI am sorry for being harsh. Reddit does that sometimes, but I mean no disrespect.', 'Bro makes a BS point about Crypto, then proceeds to say that ""Crypto has nothing to do with it"". LMAO. The irony is damning.\n\nAnd from my entire comment, all you have to offer is a small argument against G-Sync? And I specifically mentioned ghosting and not lower latency because FreeSync is not that great in motion clarity or scrolling text faster, which can feel blurry and nauseous.\n\nJust log off dude, you have now proved you got nothing and are just wasting time.', 'As per OP\'s post:\n\n> so I\'m thinking of waiting to buy whatever the highest-end model is when it releases—let\'s assume it\'s going to be called the 8900 XT.\n\nOP clearly doesn\'t have pricing as a concern and is only going for AMD because they\'re getting a 15% discount on it. And even then, they want whatever the ""highest end"" offering is and don\'t care about its price. They even switched to the 7800x3D in a heartbeat, the best gaming CPU in the market rn.\n\nI also mean no disrespect to you and got nothing against you my dude, but tbh, I think OP did confuse us both on what they actually want.', '>Bro makes a BS point about Crypto, then proceeds to say that ""Crypto has nothing to do with it"". LMAO. The irony is damning\n\nAre you stupid or something? Both are two different points. One was made to emphasise the ""FOMO"" and the second time I used it in historical context as it was the reason for initial inflation of prices.\n\nYou have proved that you are a sheep who cannot even understand language.', ""This is what lawyers do to me in client negotiations...loool. It's literally two lines before your quote that you omitted (and also forms part of the complete sentence) which says he is looking for value and he is looking for a high end AMD card...which is at a totally different price point than the high end Nvidia one.\n\nI cannot argue anymore, fuck you OP. \n\n(in good spirits)\n\nI think it's indicative of my massive middle class mentality that I cannot for the life of me separate monetary value from a product."", 'Stupidity is getting every single point of yours proven wrong, but even then, continuing to argue over a baseless claim of pricing, where the entire conversation is about ""HIGH END FUTURE PROOF"" PCs.\n\nHow long will you keep embarrassing yourself? You clearly have surface level knowledge of everything and just wanna keep arguing for the sake of it. Seriously, do something more productive with your time, or go read up on the stuff I talked about.', ""I think at this point, I'll leave it to the OP to get whatever they want. I've done my job informing them about NVIDIA, and even stated that you could get a 5070Ti and still enjoy high end gaming and not extravagantly splurge. The fact remains that be it high end, or as you say top end or whatever, NVIDIA remains the undisputable winner, unless and until you go to the true budget segment where AMD's extra VRAM and competitive raster performance shines because RT on a budget is almost a no go.\n\nEDIT: OP is clearly not aiming for the budget segment.""]"

1ew5r9e,[Build Help] Building a 1.8-1.9 Lakh PC ,"**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using:** 1440p gaming. I mainly play single player/story based AAA games. No multiplayer/competitive shooters.

**What is your maximum budget?:** 1.8-1.9 Lakh maximum.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?**: By mid September.

**Which state/city will you be purchasing the parts in?**: New Delhi, considering visiting Nehru Place.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?:** Only the tower, no peripherals.

**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?:** N/A

**Will you be overclocking?**: Not anytime soon.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build?**: A 2tb ssd for storage.

**Do you have any specific case preferences?**: Planning to use the lancool 216.

**Extra info or particulars:**

* I will buy a 1440p monitor (LG 27GP850), so I think a 4070ti super should be enough for my usecase. However, I would appreciate any suggestions.
* I'm looking for any suggestions on the brand+model of the GPU as well. Is Gigabyte Gaming OC good? Or should I go for Zotac Trinity?
* Would it better to have a separate boot ssd? If yes, what size should I get?
* I'm up for any other monitor suggestions as well. My budget would be 40K maximum. I might consume some media on the monitor but mostly for gaming and work. I picked LG because I think their displays are good.
* I picked the 7800x3d over 7600x because I wouldn't be upgrading the build for atleast the next 3-4 years (minimum), I am under the impression that the 7800x3d would be a better CPU for my usecase in the long term. ""Future proofing"" is the reason for me getting a 850w PSU as well.
* I am based in New Delhi, would it be better if I build the PC myself? Or should I go get some quotes in Nehru Place first? Not sure if I could get stuff cheaper if I buy it all from one shop. Looking for any shop suggestions as well.

Bangalore

No, cant think of any. I will be installing multiple OSes in it. Not sure if that matters.

Hi everyone, My PC is quite old (first built in 2013). Overtime I upgraded/added couple of things, like RAM, fans etc. nothing major. Last year, my PC was getting hot, so changed power supply, cabinet & cooler.

I have other peripherals, like monitor, power backup & SSD (but only SATA based, as my MoBo doesn't support nvme). Below is my current config, Currently, my pc is not much useful. I tried cleaning and all, but it cant handle much load. Cant play CS2 at all.

1eubrg8,I need help to build my PC,"All details below, I'm saving up whatever I can and intend to build one in the next 1-2 months. 
Also suggest if it's better to go buy from Lamington (Mumbai) or do I get it online (TheMVP, XRIG, or some other)

>**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**

    Tower, OS

    

>**Which state/city will you be purchasing the parts in?**

It's always better to research before buying these things.\n\nI don't think you can do a lot about it if your house is dust prone. You can keep it away from open window but Airflow is usually kinda simple: front and bottom fans intake and rear and top fans exhaust . But for dust, one thing you can do is buy a case which has dust filters for intake points like in front and keep cleaning those everything you see dust buildup. Also, only buy case with front fans side as mesh panel as this helps in airflow a lot. And if you case doesn't have dust filter, you can clean that mesh part regularly like every month or 15 days depending on the dust buildup.\n\nPrice difference between 4070 and 4070S is usually less than 5K for same brand gpus.

1eq9lg2,Received a different gaming monitor than what I ordered from Amazon India,"I gifted away my 24"" FHD 60Hz dell professional  monitor to upgrade to a bigger smoother screen and some Valorant gaming. After spending a lot of time on research I chose LG 27gp850 (1440p 180hz 1ms) however the product i received was 27gn650(1080p 144Hz 1ms). The delivery boy had marked the item as delivered before reaching the door as he called and asked if I was home earlier.

After talking to an Amazon CSR instead of replacement with correct item I am asked to return the existing product and order a new unit. I will lose the deal price because the refund won't happen in time.

Is there no QC while choosing item for delivery as there is clear mention of model number. Could it be intentional by sellers as the products sent in these cases are always lower priced. It''s frustrating to spend time and go through these procedures. I wonder buying from Amazon is even worth these days given the replacement/refund is so tedious.

Also, the MRP of item received on box is ₹25,000 and is mentioned as ₹32,500(selling price is 14,999) on Amazon before discount.

1emym01,Update: Building a 1.2-1.3 Lakh Gaming PC,"Thanks to all that commented on my last post. Valuable feedback. So here’s the follow up to my last post. Changes: 

Replaced CPU. Valid point of Intel being riddled with issues as of now.

A better PSU, with more power.

32 gigs of memory.

And a monitor. Why not.

Will buy windows key third party.

Only thing that this setup does not have now is a Cabinet. Hit me up with your recommendations!


PS: Why AMD GPU? tl;dr I don’t really care for RTX. 

I just don’t think it’s worth the FPS drop. Every other technology that nvidia has, AMD has a good enough equivalent. I will stick with AMD for this one, and why not, so is the CPU.

Over time, I upgraded its parts bit by bit, turning it into a low-end gaming PC. It wasn't the best, but it was mine, and I could play almost any game on low to mid settings.

The journey from my first PS2 to my current gaming PC has taught me the value of patience and determination.

1ejb495,Budget Monitor Recommendation for video-editing,"Hey everyone!

I'm looking to upgrade my monitor from an old Samsung SyncMaster 2233 to a new one, within the 24-27 inch range. I will be using it primarily for video editing and occasional single player gaming, so colour accuracy is a high priority (refresh rate, not much so). Apart from that, features like multiple ports (for switching between PC and Laptop), inbuilt speakers and USB ports for peripherals would be nice, though not a must.

My budget for the same is 10-15k, and as such expect mostly 1080p monitors in this range (My PC has a 1050 Ti, so can't really handle games on high quality at a high res). However, if there are good 1440p monitors in the 15-20k range, please recommend them as well.

For now, I've found these three monitors -

1eb5ok1,Where can I find a replacement adapter for my LG monitor?,"I have a 27 inch ultragear. One day, it just stopped working when I booted my PC. When I ran my tester through different points to diagnose, I realised that my adapter is at fault.

Even with higher amperage, a 6mm pin is impossible to lookup? Perhaps it's my extremely exhausted mind. The only direct option is through desertcart, but it's 3.5k.

First time builder here, after an evening of research I came up with this [build](https://pcpricetracker.in/b/s/79b10cf5-872e-4ba5-8d72-6d2772af5653).

Use case:  
It needs to be a console under my LG C22 OLED tv(4k/120).

Is the build good enough to play most modern games in 4k, >60fps? I have gone with Nvidia because of DLSS and RT(RT is not a dealbreaker but I would like to have it).

Is there anything can be swapped adjusted to have a similar/Required performance and reliability but at a lower price ?

2) 16gb ram .
3) 165hz Lg ultra gear . 

I use to play game like  12-15 years ago, so I wanted your help from where I can download or purchase games and is it worth purchasing like EA PASS ? How does it work now ?

Games I usually play: 
FPS series, call of duty. , medal of honour, fifa, NFS. 

I don’t mind playing old titles as well, till I purchase a good graphic card. 

Back then I use to download from torrent and it worked like a charm , however I’m struggling to download from torrent as most of it doesn’t have a direct torrent link and it fails, plus the Malware’s these torrent file contains. 
I’m looking for your help and suggestions regarding downloading the game or purchase some subscription and which games would run in HD 730 graphic card. 

Thanks in advance

1e8hhbv,Connecting my Monitor across 2 laptops - Need help ,"Hi, 

I plan on buying a [LG Ultragear 27GN800](https://amzn.in/d/05txQbqs) Monitor which supports HDMI & DP. 

I use a MacBook Pro M1 for work (Type C) and a Lenovo Legion Y540 (HDMI, Mini DP, Type C) to game. 

I want to know what’s the best way of connecting the monitor to my devices without losing quality, as DP will support G Sync. 

I don’t want to connect both simultaneously- but want to know what kind of adaptors / hubs would I need. 

Do I need a DP to USB C, which I can use with the Lenovo Legion & Macbook?

I’m unsure about the best combination to use, please guide me. 

Thank you! ",2024-07-21 08:15:08,[]
1e8ey2i,PS5 or a 55k GPU upgrade?,"Hi guys,  
  
I currently have a PC with these specs:  
AMD 5600X CPU  
16 GB RAM  
RTX 2060 6GB  
2TB SSD storage

I'm thinking of upgrading my GPU for gaming on my LG oled tv. (Currently plays at 1080p via Moonlight stream, overheats a bit tho)

Was wondering if it makes more sense to buy a PS5 instead of a RTX 4070 (\~55k) or 7800 XT (\~53k)? The usage here is primarily playing the latest titles on my screen / TV.  
  
Does the PS5 deliver better 4k gaming experience than the above build with the new GPU (including DLSS/FSR)?

 Is Hdmi to DP cable safe, because in the manual it is not recommended.

1. Refresh rate : atleast 120hz.

3. Size: 27 inches.
4. Budget - 20,000.
5. Adjustments - should have height adjustment. Swivel and pivot are good to have.

1dt1cy3,Crinacle x Zero red for PS5(connected to controller) or any alternatives,"Hey guys, i have been using the Razer blackshrk V2 X headset for around 3 years, initially bought it for pc then now i switched to ps5, but for the past few months i am really getting sweating and allergy due to over head cusion, same with my office headset even after cleaning it many times so now i have switched to a cheap 500rs inear earphone for past 3 months, now i want to get a pretty good inear and budget is 5k, and i will be connecting to 3.5mm on my dualsense, its a mandatory since i always play on my tv(nice lg c3 btw :D ) and i can't run a cable across the living room.

I have researched quite a lot and finalysed this crinacle x zero red, is it a good option for my use case? I play mainly story games and some occasional mw3 with friends. 

Iem seems like a new thing now in gaming and see a lot of pros. I also dont like too much bass i prefer more clear voices/musics in story games and good mids

Is there any other alternative iems which you think as a better option? Has anyone used crinacle x zero red/blue and how's your experience?

1dr5bwr,Got an LG monitor - Defective ,"Hello everyone, 

I recently purchased a LG monitor (24MR400). I believe it is defective. From day one the display is like this (as shown in picture) on black screen. After setting up the monitor i found this. As i bought this from a shop which is bit far from my home, instead of taking it to the shop i called lg service center. After 4days lg technician arrived only to say that this is normal for  monitors and even for TVs so he will not replace it. I want your opinion and suggestions, is it normal or defective and what i can do. Thank you for reading.",2024-06-29 07:00:16,"['I guess that the picture is worse than reality!?\n\nImo the bottom corners are normal (ips glow)\n\nBut the upper ones seems to have a bit of bleeding, which might be less normal!']"

1dm1ves,Need help with finding UPS!!,"I built a new gaming PC and am for a UPS for my PC. I'm not sure where or who to ask so I'm just asking here and hoping I'll get some help 🤞 (below are the specs)

Processor: i5-13400f  
Mobo: B760M DS3H AX DDR5  
GPU: RTX 4070 windforce OC 12GB  
PSU: Cooler master 750 V2 80 plus bronze  
SSD: 1tb SN770  
RAM: Corsair 16gb 5200mhz DDR5  
Cooler: Deepcool AG620

Along with this, I use LG 27GN800 144hz monitor and Logitech G213 keyboard

The 2 UPS I found the most appealing are these

1. APC BX1100C: [https://amzn.in/d/0aM7TczC](https://amzn.in/d/0aM7TczC)  
2. Artis 1500VA: [https://amzn.in/d/0arSalNv](https://amzn.in/d/0arSalNv)

Which of these should I go with? will 1100VA be enough for my PC or should I go with 1500VA?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/IndianGaming) if you have any questions or concerns.*', 'PSU how many watt\nAnd which motherboard', 'TBH you can upgrade whole pc in that much budget if you go for used parts.', ""Any specific upgrade you want? I wouldn't bother with upgrading such an old dead end platform unless you want new monitors or something."", ""Are you looking to upgrade everything? What are you using the PC for?\n\nThat platform is over 10 years old at this point and unless you are looking for minor upgrades then I wouldn't throw more money at it."", ""You should rather build a new pc try selling the old one and add that to the budget if you haven't already."", ""You say it's a 2015 PC, but the GPU is from 2011 and the CPU is a 2 core/4 thread unit from 2013. \n\nThere's no one part you can upgrade that wouldn't immediately be held back by the remaining archaic parts. By held back, I mean that you wouldn't get the full potential performance of the new part.  \nEven if you bump up to the most powerful CPU your motherboard can take, the decade old GPU is still going to be the problem. And vice versa if you swap the GPU for something more modern; it'll just be choked out by an ancient CPU. \n\nSo you want to replace both. Cool. Now the issue is that your very tired motherboard doesn't have the PCIe bandwidth to take full advantage of the new parts. It may also be lacking support for the latest storage drives. Because even swapping to an SSD is going to be held back by the Motherboard's old SATA standards, and your board likely doesn't support m.2 NVMe at all.\n\nSo now the motherboard is also on the chopping block... And at this point, just build a new PC. You'll get access to new technologies (m.2 drives for a start), and even though you likely can't afford the most cutting-edge build in 30-40K, it'll still be night and day compared to your current machine.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \nYour budget means that an AM5 rig is out of the question. So, I'm going to recommend you a cheap AM4 based setup. You'll get good performance for the price, and AM4 has a little bit of runway left for future upgrades should you want it. Prices are broadly indicative and come from PrimeABGB and MDComputers.\n\n> CPU: Ryzen 5 3200G for about Rs. 5,500 (Comes packaged with an air cooler)  \n> Mobo: Gigabyte B 450M DS3H WiFi for about Rs. 6,700 (Non-WiFi model available for Rs 5,400.)  \n> RAM: 2x8GB RAM Sticks clocked at 3600 MHz for about Rs. 5,000 (This can vary depending on brand)  \n> SDD: Crucial P3 500GB PCIe M.2 NVMe Gen 3 SSD for about Rs. 4,000  \n> PSU: 500W PSU for about Rs 3,000 (Varies by brand, 500W is enough for a budget build, but nothing more)  \n> Case: Ant Esports ICE-130AG RGB Cabinet (Matte Black) ICE-130AG for about Rs 3,000 (and another few hundred for fans)\n\nNow, the above is what will form the structure of your PC. If your current PSU that's 450W and above, you can skip the PSU and put the savings towards the GPU. Same if you can reuse your existing case. More money for the GPU. You can reuse your existing HDD has a secondary drive for this new build.\n\nAssuming a budget of 40,000, we should have about 13K left in budget for the graphics card. For that I would recommend...\n\nGPU: Gigabyte GTX 1650 D6 Windforce OC for about Rs 13,000.  \nThis is a perfectly reasonable entry-level 1080p GPU and is miles ahead of your current GT 510. More than enough for your current monitor, if you adjust your in-game settings correctly.\n\nBut if you can save on the PSU and/or Case I'd more than recommend\n\nGPU: Colourful GTX 1660 Super NB V2-V Battle AX for about Rs. 18,000.  \nThis is a big step up from the 1650 and the extra 2GB of VRAM will help push back the need for another upgrade by some time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------  \nThere. For your budget, I think this is the best you can get on the open market today. Though if I'm wrong I expect the other commenters will suggest even better alternatives.   \nAs a final note, getting some of the parts second-hand (like the Case and GPU) can reduce the price even further, but only you know how much risk you're willing to tolerate. I recently put together a PC made entirely of secondhand parts, and I got quite the bargain, but your story is yours to write.\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck."", ""I don't think anything from your old build is useable anymore other than the storage and the case,\n\n\nGet something like this,\n\n\nI used pcpricetracker.in for the prices\n\n\n\xa0 \xa0I3 12100f 6.9k\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0 \xa0Msi h610 pro-e 6.1k\n\n\n\xa0 Ddr4 3200mhz cl19 8x2 2.6k Amazon\xa0\n\n\n\xa0 512gb gen 3 SSD 2.6k\xa0 Amazon\xa0\n\n\n\xa0 550w tier c psu 3.3k\n\n\n\xa0 GPU-\xa0 Intel arc a750 gb 18.9k\n\n\n\xa0 Or Rx 6600 19.7k\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0 Total 40,234rs or 40,800rs if you went with Rx 6600.

My primary focus here is LG as a brand itself is better than multiple other companies. I have looked over some reviews on the internet and got to know LG is one of the best in the industry. So do lemme know about your opinions on the monitor and is it worth the bucks or not.

1d2ny4z,Need opinions on this build,"Planning to build a gaming PC around 1.2 lakh, came up with this build so far. Wanted to know if I could cheap out on something or can get a discount in offline stores (Bangalore).

Building it for 1440p gaming, so a 1440p monitor with a decent 1440p card (7900 gre should handle this well) would be required. A motherboard with wifi is preferred.

1cyt26g,need your advise on a 27 or 32 inch 4k monitor.,"hello everyone. I would be deeply obliged if you can help me out on choosing a 4k monitor.  
My requirements:  
first and foremost should i go 27 inch or 32 inch.

1. text quality and crispness is top priority. ( i am diabetic)
2. Colour manifestation is important, it should not have a washed out vibe. I am BTW not seeking colour accuracy.
3. Absolutely non-gaming purpose. Catering primarily for simulation and CFD post processing regarding colour reproduction.
4. Brand reliability. I may be going for a gas damper arm later so mounting accessories are not important and neither is USB-c. Budget is<= 30K strictly.

i have filtered to the following options:

1.View Sonic -VX2762U-4K

2. LG-32UN650-W.

3. Dell-S2722QC.  
please feel free to suggest your choices.

1cuormf,Buy High End Gaming Monitor or OLED TV.,"Hey Everyone 👋, 

Age 28, Casual Console Gamer Here. 1 have 2 questions 

1. 
I have Both Xbox Series X and PS5 for gaming and presently i use them with a Nokia 55 inch 60HZ TV. Now to get a turn for gaming after family drama is difficult,Hence My decision to Buy a High End Monitor (for Spare room which can be converted to gaming room) or a OLED TV which would be replaced with Nokia LED TV in Main Living room and get it (Nokia TV)for gaming in my 2nd Living Room Upstairs.
So If I buy a OLED TV it would not benefit me for gaming but it would just get me a 55 inch TV. In case i get a monitor it will be my main screen only.
Suggestions Please 🙏 

2. Incase you suggest buying a Gaming Monitor 
     Which one.
   
 - 4K IPS Panel
   * BenQ Mobiuz EX3210U
   * GIGABYTE M32U 
   * LG 32GR93U-B

- 2K IPS Panel 
   * LG 32GP850-B
   * any other recommendation 

- 4K OLED Panel
   * Alienware AW3225QF

1crnr5l,I asked Gemini to help me build a PC. How did it do?,"**This is the response:**

With your budget of ₹150,000-200,000, target resolution of 1440p 144Hz (or 120Hz) with the possibility of 4K 60Hz, and no immediate plans for streaming or content creation, here's a balanced PC build we can aim for:

**Processor (CPU):**

* **Option 1:** Intel Core i5-13600K - Offers excellent gaming performance and good value.
* **Option 2:** AMD Ryzen 5 7600X - A strong competitor to the i5-13600K with slightly better multi-core performance.

**Graphics Card (GPU):**

* **Option 1:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 - A powerful GPU that can handle 1440p gaming at high refresh rates and even some 4K gaming.
* **Option 2:** AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT - Offers similar performance to the RTX 4070 and might be available at a slightly lower price.

**Motherboard:**

* **For Intel:** ASUS ROG Strix B660-A Gaming WiFi - A feature-rich motherboard with good overclocking potential.
* **For AMD:** MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi - A solid motherboard with excellent VRM for the Ryzen 5 7600X.

**Memory (RAM):**

* 32GB DDR5 RAM (2x16GB) - Sufficient for gaming and future-proofing.

**Storage:**

* 1TB Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSD - Fast and reliable storage for your OS and games.
* 2TB Seagate Barracuda HDD - Additional storage for larger files.

**Power Supply (PSU):**

* 750W Corsair RM750x - A high-quality, fully modular PSU with plenty of power for your components.

**Case:**

* Fractal Design Meshify 2 Compact - Excellent airflow and a sleek design.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **CPU Cooler:** Noctua NH-D15 or similar for good cooling performance, especially if you plan to overclock.
* **Monitor:** Choose a 1440p 144Hz monitor (or 120Hz) from reputable brands like LG, ASUS, or Acer.
* **Peripherals:** Invest in a good gaming keyboard, mouse, and headset.

>**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**

* Yeah I might overclock especially for speeding up the rendering process.

>**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Yes looking for a good 4TB HDD 

>**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Not much interested in RGB, also don't mind if it is there, but cooling is main preference over RGB lighting or even size..

>**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* I already have one windows 11 connected to my Microsoft account, which came with my old laptop ( currently dead- since one month) 

So one of my main preferences is powerful cooling, because the rendering will use high power and produce extreme temperatures so I want a cooling unit that can handle extreme temperatures...

I already made a post regarding confusion between AMD vs Intel/nvidia and decide to go with AMD CPU and nvidia GPU....

So I am considering 1.1/2+ lakh to the PC excluding graphic card and with the choose the graphic card based on the remaining amount....

Current build preference: 

CPU - ryzen 7950x or 7950x 3D( if better for work load) 

MOTHERBOARD - which can handle the full potential of both processes and gpu without any tweaking(under/over clocking ) also should support atleast 128GB of RAM(4800-6000MT) 

RAM - 128/64GB ( 4800-6000MT) will choose bigger RAM over faster Ram because of the constrains in simulations.

PSU - need something future proof (1000wt) preferably..

CABINET and COOLING UNIT - performance (cooling) over looks 

GPU - need atleast (16GB ) or (12GB) VRAM 

STORAGE - 4TB SSD or HDD 
(Seagate IronWolf 3.5 Inches SATA 6 Gb/s 5900 RPM 64 MB Cache - current preference) 

MOUSE : durable middle button 
( Logitech - G402 - current option ) 

Keyboard : including numpad 

MONITOR : ultra wide monitor with good refresh rate and colour accuracy... Prefer ips 
( Current options 
GIGABYTE G34Wqc A 34"" - not available online

I initially bought the [Samsung Odyssey G7 (28 inches)](https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-28-inch-Compatible-Experience-LS28BG700EWXXL/dp/B0CC55P4R8/) but returned it since it causing me severe eye strain.

1cezr6l,"PSA: Do not buy a monitor for your console, instead get a TV.","Way too many posts keep popping up, that compel me to make this post. So here are a couple of reasons why a Smart TV just makes far more sense than a Monitor.

Monitors are often overpriced and worse than your standard 4k TV. Look at their spec sheets and you would realize most monitors don't support HDR and even the ones don't have enough brightness to make use of HDR. With a TV you tend to get a bigger screen, better image/sound quality and just far more versatility.

Also while both Xbox Series X and PS5, support up to 120 fps. Very few AAA games would actually be able to achieve anything above 60 fps. Furthermore the jump from 60 to 120 while noticeable, is not as drastic as the jump from 30 to 60. So better to get a 4k 60hz Display over any 1440/1080p 144hz gaming monitor.

Talking about price, TVs tend to be cheaper while giving you far more bang for your buck if you are crossing that 25k threshold. Reason for this is pretty simple, Gaming monitors are niche items whereas Smart TVs are bulk items sold at more competitive prices.

As for TV suggestions, just look up any Hisense / TCL / VU / Toshiba or similar reputed brands for good deals. If budget is no concern, then obviously go for OLeds from LG, Samsung or Sony.

Still there are a couple of exceptions where you still would prefer a Monitor.

* Your budget is less than 20k. If possible, try to extend it to that 25-30k range for your console. 
* If your Console is Older Gen like Xbox 360 or base PS4, a 1080p 60hz monitor is all you need.
* You have very limited desk space. 42 inch monitors and wall mounting do exist, but if that is still too big for your space it makes more sense for a monitor.
* You are an esports console player. TVs will always have worse latency than a monitor, and while a 5ms latency difference will barely be noticed by 99% of the player base, if you belong that to 1% that need all the edge, then yes a low latency monitor makes more sense. Same is true if you are looking for high refresh rate display.
* You need a monitor anyways for Office/Productivity Work.",2024-04-28 06:31:24,"['Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Primarily a developer and linux admin. I use vmware, photoshop, python java, powerpoint, lot of downloads and uploads with 50-60gb downloads and uploads every week or so for company or personal reasons unlimited internet.


Need suggestions for a new monitor and cpu cabinet, already have speakers, cam, mic already setup.

My old build that broke yesterday, bought in 2016 for 35k
I3 7100
Gt 730 ddr5 2gb
Acer 720p monitor
16gb ddr4 2400
1tb 870 pro sata
4tb hdd segate
Random psu 
Random case cabinet


Now planning on buying a new pc that is good for my above requirements but a good future proof.
My budget monitor cpu GPU all included 1.2lakh ir below great but if a great value for money if available in CTC hyderabad would stretch to 1.5l with emis. Dont need a over kill build either.

Would like 1440p gaming as i understand that is the sweet spot at 144hz.

Cpu 7600 19k or 7700 32k
Gpu 4060 8gb 30k, 4070 super 63k
Mb b650m 16k
No cpu cooler unless really needs for best value and performance over long term
32gb ddr5 6000 10k
Psu corsair rme 750w 11k+
Cabinet any good one but thinking corsair 4000d 6k
1440p 144hz hdr10 lg ultragear 27gn800 24k or even better one if available at good budget.
1tb nvme samsung 990 pro 11k
Hdd using old 4tb one as it has all my data.


Now iam asking this community to help me decide which config to go for as i need a good budget to performance ratio if getting great deals which should i focus on dont like online because would rather buy from a shop test if everything is working ifnot has the option to repair or return quick unlike amazon and need the pc in a week as i buy.

Thanks for any and all suggestions

I've finalized two 27 inch 1440p monitors and a little confused which one should I buy.

2. [MSI G274QPF E2](https://amzn.in/d/atikjib)

The last two monitors I had were from LG and I never had any issues with them. I prefer LG over MSI, but the higher specs on MSI for the same price are a bit tempting. Guys, need your suggestions which one should I go for?

1c3qmqz,HP service experience and the need of extended warranty.,"I thought of sharing my HP aftersales experience and underscoring the need of getting extended warranty for expensive laptops.

I bought my HP Omen (Ryzen, RTX 3060) back in 2021 from HP's website. I costed me around 1.25 lakhs and I also bought an extended warranty of 2 years for 1500(there was some offer going on at that time, hence the low cost).

Unfortunately my first hardware issue came pretty soon. After 8 months, the windows key stopped working and the white led lights around the WASD started malfunctioning. I immediately called the helpline and they guided me in the diagnostics. That didn't help and the agent arranged for an onsite visit by a technician. After a day the technician came with a replacement keyboard. One thing I noticed that the technician wasn't very familiar with the laptop and he took time figuring out layout of the internals. However he managed to change the keyboard without any issues.

My second hardware issue came recently, about 1 and half years after the first incident. One fine night while I was gaming, the screen started artifacting all of a sudden. Immediately I called the helpline the next morning and after diagnostics, the agent arranged for a technician visit. This time there were two people. One a head technician and another an assistant. I could tell by the way they were handling the laptop that they were experienced. They also had all the necessary tools like the OEM double-sided tape used to hold the side bezels of the plastic frame around the screen in place. The fit and finish after the replacement was thus good.

I noticed that the replacement screen was not the same as the original. They replaced the original AUO display with a LG display . I would say the LG one is slightly better since the AUO one used to flicker ever so slightly when the display was cold. It was a very minute issue and the flickering used to go away after 5 minutes of usage.

Since I had extended warranty , I didn't have to pay anything . Otherwise the original display would have costed me around 20000.

In conclusion, I am satisfied by the after-sales service of HP. Though I am slightly disappointed by the two hardware failures in a span of 3 years, I may still go for an OMEN laptop in the future(with extended warranty of course).",2024-04-14 10:40:58,"['Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1c2dinu,RTX 3070 confusion?,"RTX 3070 confusion?

I planning to build a PC with the following specs

Processor - ryzen 7600
Mobo- MSI GAMING plus wifi b650
Cabinet - Montech Air 903 black or antec df7000 flux ATX
PSU - 750W ( mid tier )
SSD - SN580 1 tb
RAM - 5200mhz cl40 16x2
Cooler- Lian Li galahad Trinity 2 240mm
Monitor - LG 27GP850-B 1440p

GPU - gonna put in a used GPU for probably 2 years, later on upgrade to a better 1440p GPU after Witcher,GTA 6 releases.

But I'm confused which one to get.
1. The games I'm gonna play this year - Horizon Forbidden West, ELDEN Ring DLC, God of War, and some casual Apex with Friends.
2. Here in my region, used 3070 and 6700xt cost the same( around 20-22k) sometimes 3070 even cheaper also 6700xt is quite difficult to get.
3. I am building this pc exclusively for Horizon Forbidden West for now. 6700XT can barely run Forbidden West 1440p high at 60 fps  in native performance, but RTX 3070 with DLSS quality can run it better than the former. I strongly believe that DLSS Quality looks far better than FSR.
4. I can also get 3080 at around 30k, but the whole build will go out of my budget as I'll have to buy a better a better PSU too. Probably around 15-18k more. Will it be worth it then? 8 to 10 GB VRAM upgrade?


Considering the games I'll play in the next year's, please suggest me if it will be good to go for an RTX 3070 ?",2024-04-12 16:27:51,"['Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1c25xql,Which gaming monitor should I buy?,"I have a PS5 which is hooked up to a LG CX TV. The setup is amazing but the only catch is that the way my room is set up, I have to sit on the bed for longer periods of time while gaming which has now started to hurt my back at times. So I have decided to get a desk, chair and gaming monitor to improve this situation. 

I think a 27” monitor should be suitable for me because firstly, I’ll mostly be playing Call of duty with my friends which has the output of 1440p with 120 hz refresh rate on ps5. From what I’ve read online, 27” monitors are suitable for that requirement. Secondly, I’ll keep the ps5 connected to my main TV (55” 4K) as well for the causal gaming so I don’t need a monitor to do 4K 120 because my TV already does that. Thirdly, my budget is around 20k with maximum 25k. 

My questions are :-

1.  Is the 27” monitor actually suitable as per my requirements mentioned above? Should I look for something else? 

2. Which features should I look out for that are a must have in the monitor? VRR? HDR? Response time? 

3. Which monitors should I go for in the 27” minimum 120 hz (144 hz?) segment given my budget? Would appreciate the brand name or model name. 

4. Off topic but I’m looking at “Greensoul” brand for gaming chair and desk. I have read good reviews of it online. Would you suggest this brand only or something else?

I know this is fcuking stupid, but i am using 4070Super and 7800x3D on 75hz 1080p monitor.

Samsung 240hz monitor in wishlist, soon.

But i observed 4070s eats only 40-80Watt in all games ultra setting. This card is damn power efficient. Same with 7800x3D it eats only 40-50watt.

Also Ignore online prices, i build this PC for 160k (y2024) + 10k for monitor (old monitor from 2018).

btw Forbidden West is gorgeous.

1bznhfd,Can i play games at 1080p on monitor in a 2k monitor,"Hi, I have been playing on a 1080p 144Hz 24-inch monitor for a long time. I wanted a bigger screen since I have a PS5, where I mostly play story games. On PC, I watch movies, edit videos, and play some older and new games, alot of Overwatch 2. Recently, I have been feeling that my monitor is a bit small while watching movies and playing games on my PS5.

These are the game genres I mostly play:

* 3rd person story games
* 2D platformers
* AAA titles on my PS5 mostly, unless it's free or cheap on PC.

My question is, if I buy a 2K monitor, can I connect it to my PC and play games on 1080p since my PC can't handle above 1080p for sure? (PS5 can run native 2K res, so no need to worry about PS5.)

My PC specs:

* Ryzen 5 3600X
* RTX 2060 Super
* 16GB single stick RAM

Current monitor: Samsung 144Hz 24-inch curved gaming monitor.

I'm planning to buy one of these:

[LG 32"" (80 CM) Ultragear QHD Monitor (2560 X 1440 Pixels), 165 Hz, 1Ms, Nvidia G-Sync Compatible, Freesync Premium, HDR 10, Hdmi, Tilt, Height, Pivot Stand, VA Panel Gaming LCD Monitor, 32GN650 Black](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B09YDJ75SH/?coliid=I383EW6UUZVSIO&colid=E94DS0BZM4JN&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)

[BenQ MOBIUZ EX3210R QHD 31.5""(81cm) VESA DisplayHDR400 VA Curved Gaming Monitor with Remote-1000R,90% DCI-P3,165Hz,1ms MPRT,AMD FreeSync Premium Pro,treVolo Speakers,HDMI,DP,USB 3.0Hub(Metallic Grey)](https://www.amazon.in/BenQ-EX3210R-31-5-inch-FreeSync-Adjustable/dp/B097PDHQW9)

  
I'm not good with tech stuff, so if you have any better suggestions, please let me know. All I need is a bigger screen where I can use it for PC, play games on 144Hz or above without blurriness, use it for PS5, watch movies, and edit videos.

1. Dell-S2422Hg https://amzn.in/d/6pu8Q3S
2. LG 24GN60R https://amzn.in/d/0DTCvZR
I was also checking out Samsung G3, but according to a YT review, it has serious ghosting. Out of above two, Dell has deep blacks due to VA panel, curved screen and a bit higher refresh rate, while LG is IPS, so better colors and viewing angles, swivel stand which dell lacks, and best response time.

So anyone has any recommendation out of these two. I have not considered the one from MSI, as I have never bought MSI products and hence not sure about after sale service.

1bxvqi6,"🌟 Seeking Recommendations for Best HDR Games on 48"" LG OLED C3 🌟","Hi everyone 👋,

I recently upgraded my gaming setup with a 48-inch LG OLED C3 TV 📺 and am looking to fully experience its HDR capabilities. 🌈

Can anyone recommend games that are particularly stunning in HDR? I'm interested in titles that really pop with color 🎨, have deep blacks 🖤, and utilize the high dynamic range to its fullest. Genre-wise, I'm open to anything - from fast-paced action and adventure 🏃‍♂️🏞️ to immersive RPGs 🧙‍♂️ and visually striking indies 🎮.

Also, if there are specific settings or calibration tips 🛠️ to get the best HDR experience on the LG OLED C3, I'd appreciate that insight as well!

Thanks in advance for your recommendations! 🙏",2024-04-07 04:38:15,[]

1btszol,Comparing color accuracy of monitors,"Some of the monitors advertise their color accuracy in terms of sRGB and some as DCI-P3. How to know which is better when comparing them?

This shows as 99% sRGB gamut coverage.  

* Acer Nitro Xv272u v3

Keeping these points in mind, my budget is 10k(give or take 2k), and I shortlisted a few viable options:

1. [MSI g2422](https://www.amazon.in/MSI-G2422-FreeSyncTM-Technology-Anti-Flicker/dp/B0BP2Q9F4L/ref=sr_1_1?crid=HEO41LOLPUDM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2YBftcXRY_WGndCj2cKwpwCadaoAUkrtTt3UgMCR1_RLzYUS9rbgnWofs2FHRjxRW0ZoH8e2H0LfBO4RU0k77l7-aTQrz_k9Eaonu-FXErdoxLgQ0i9Jw5CBSez-EKW6lFfzax8aO-RSxIJTVQGppoJeaLa8DsxasWTqHLPBkTLzXGRc8FVwZlasM1Zpl-B-6S8W9wbTcpHIy-zN4Cjjv7kWOprbACN3S8cEVdRYk6o.v_p1xftcDcnE9MzAAmHb0Y3ugkv25HZaIBnK9huHHmw&dib_tag=se&keywords=msi%2Bg2422&qid=1711362872&sprefix=msi%2Bg2422%2Caps%2C317&sr=8-1&th=1) - 9 or 10k - Best bang for the buck, but HDMI 1.4b of the monitor will limit refresh rate to max 144hz@1080p.
2. [LG Ultragear gn65r](https://www.amazon.in/LG-Ultragear-Monitor-FreeSync-Compatible-24GN65R/dp/B0C5MPH9G7?th=1) -  11.7k - Good option, has HDMI 2.0 port, but 144hz, seems to have highest backlight bleeding out of all, and more expensive

I'm really confused between the first 3 options. I was set on msi, but the HDMI 1.4b port complicates things. I can purchase a displayport to USB type c cable, but good quality ones cost 2k+, which is good chunk of the monitors price.  
  
Im dreading the after sales experience of getting a replacement in case of dead pixels or high backlight bleed. I researched about their service reviews, surprisingly only msi seems to have a decent replacement experience. Saw a lot of negative service review on LG surprisingly, otherwise it's a safe bet. My heart is set on Gigabyte, but if there's any issue with the monitor, the entire replacement process might take months. And I heard they refused replacement for some cases.

Hi IndianGaming community

Looking to buy a new gaming setup within the next month. I already have a nice keyboard from Royal Kludge so do not need that. The rest is in the ballpark of 1.3 lakh. Any suggestions? Will be using this setup primarily for gaming and some personal AI projects. I have to go with nVidia for the Cuda support so no AMD on that front.

This was the second build that I was looking at. I had added an Acer Nitro VG271U from Amazon which is currently priced at 16331. Making the total out to be 1.4L. Changed it to XV272U V3 after a suggestion from the comments.

I will have to buy an AIO as I do not want to run an AC throughout the day. And the air temperatures in the summer can be a huge pain. I also need the memory as the data processing makes use of the system memory rather than the GPU VRAM, which is utilised mostly during modeling.

1bhh6ji,Need advice/Suggestion for Dual monitor setup!!,"Hello fellow gamers!!

I'm in that stage where I buy stuff to satisfy my inner child but don't find enough time to enjoy a good gaming session.  I travel for work to another state a few times in a month so it reduces game time further. This is my current gaming/WFH setup. I need help buying a monitor for work and gaming since I use my PS4 and LG 43' for most of my gaming on RPG games and some 2k/FIFA.

So, my current requirement is a 32'' or bigger Ultrawide  4k monitor that needs to be sharp for Word/Excel,  good for movie watching, and 120HZ for gaming. I might add another small 27'' color-accurate monitor for slight photo/video editing in the future(hobby)

I thought of going for the below options, budget below 50k might stretch if it's worth the value with reliability and longevity.

1:  GIGABYTE G34Wqc

2:  Samsung  Odyssey   G7or G5

3: LG ultragear ( 32GP850-B )

**Current peripherals**

ASUS TUF Dash F15Intel Core i7-12650H 12th Gen, RTX 3060. (Suped up to 32 gigs RAMand 2TB SSD)

IPAD pro 11"" (2021) / PS4 /LG 43"" 4k

MX keys Combo / Razer Basilisk V3 /  Keychron V3 /  Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Pro Dock

Any suggestions for lighting to spice up gaming session?

Thanks :)

1bf8bvl,Advice needed on ultrawide monitor.,"Posted this on the Ultrawidemasterace subreddit too because I wanted to cover all bases.

I’m currently looking for a budget ultrawide monitor as an upgrade to my current one (a Benq 1080p monitor, 24”). Not really planning on splurging or doing a massive overhaul to my current setup (the graphics card is a GTX 1660 ti) as it serves me just fine for my gaming and productivity needs, and probably has enough life in it for another year or two. That being said, I’ve always found the ultrawide form factor quite appealing and I’m sure would be quite useful for the type of work I do.

I did find this one 29 inch from LG that looks pretty promising but there aren’t too many reviews on this particular model (or on budget ultrawide monitors in general). Link is given below.

https://www.lg.com/in/monitors/ultrawide/29wq600-w/

Was wondering if anyone had any experience with this model, and could give recommendations or even alternatives perhaps.

And apologies in advance if this is one of those ignorant queries that everyone gets ever so often. In which case, I’ll quietly show myself out. :P",2024-03-15 07:28:37,"['Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's 2024 mate anything lesser than 350 nits or so is just pure waste to buy for long run.\n\nYou need the monitor for editing only right then don't even think about Viewsonic monitor under 10k. Viewsonic Omini series is good and that too some models. The one Viewsonic Xg2431 which retails around 23k and has a Motion Busters 2.0 Certification so that is a banger deal but as per your budget i would suggest only two monitors which are nearby 10k and has more potential then Others in the segment.\n\n1. MSI G2412 - It is the best choice for you retails around 10.6k no competition near it under 12k. Mind it has 458 nits brightness so it won't disappoint you even for media consumption too and has a 102% Srgb so even for editing it is nice. It is 170Hz IPS Panel.\n\n2. GIGABYTE G24F - It is also very good there is only sacrifice which is around 370 nits brightness which is lesser than MSI G2412 but the area where it excels over MSI is Ports it has 2 USB ports along with some better mangement for cable. It is 165Hz IPS Panel with OC can go to 180Hz which has support of **HDR** which is very good for media consumption too. It has better adjustment over MSI too. It also has 125% Srgb. \n\n  \nSo it's your call if you want something which needs to have more features like more Refresh rate, Ports with more Srgb & Monitor adjustments then Gigabyte is for you. If you want to stay with better brighness then MSI is for you."", 'That helps a lot!', ':) No problem mate always here to help.']"

1b9moya,Sending this bad boy back!,"So I bought this monitor (LG 27GR75Q) from Amazon on March 1, got delivered on March 4, I set it up on march 5, it stopped working on March 7, and return is scheduled for March 10!

For the time I used it, I was okay with it, color looked good, I spent a lot of time trying to color calibrate it. 

I went from using my 15 inch laptop to 27 monitor, didn’t blew me away with the size but definitely an upgrade!

Now I need a monitor, should I buy this one again? Or are there better options I should look into?

And should I buy something already or wait for Amazon to pick it up and refund my money, and then buy something!

I just purchased this monitor and am running it off a HDMI 2.0 port directly via my laptop’s rtx2060. The overclock option is locked and hence the refresh rate is stuck at 144hz. The monitor is for 160hz with 180 at overclock. I’ve installed lg’s on screen control but nothing seems to help. My laptop also has a displayport 1.2 via a usb c connector at the back. What should I do? Also I can’t seem to get the gsync option in nvidia control panel though the monitor is gsync compatible. The laptop houses an i7-10750H if that helps.

(Although its showing 160hz thats because I’ve overclocked it through the nvidia control panel.

1b2s5hd,A PC Build for 4K gaming ,"Okay first of all, I did check previous posts, and although there was some pretty valuable information, it's not quite what I'm looking for. Same with youtube videos and other forums. 

I have an LG C2 which I purchased for my PS5, so I don't have the bandwidth for another monitor. I want to buy a PC for the following reason : I'm not satisfied with the freedom offered by consoles, the upscaled quality is not that great, even when playing at 60fps, and I understand PC gives more freedom. 

My budget is 1.5 to 2 lakh. While I understand 4K builds require atleast 2.5 lakh, i am not fps hungry, and can settle for 60fps (or even 45 fps in some cases), as long as the graphics and the overall quality is visually superior to consoles. 

Following are my questions 

1) Is it better to go for a 4k build and use my existing TV at this price point, or is it better to buy a 1440p monitor with a similar build? (and how much would that cost + would it look as good as the PS5?) 

2) Alternatively, can I settle for 1440p gaming on the TV itself? Would that take a visible hit on quality as compared to 4K?

Thanks a lot guys, appreciate the support. ",2024-02-29 05:03:38,"['Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1ard7bx,Gaming Setup and Verdict,"Hello, I’m a  longtime hardcore gamer. Have been gaming since the first ATARI came out. 

This is my setup. I’ll mention the equipmentss used. If people have specific question about anything shown in this picture, I’m more than happy to answer. 

1) PLAYSTATION 5 (got it on launch day from Khan Market Delhi/Mercury, got with a Day 1 Purchase Certificate and a Big Bar of Dairy Milk 🙂 Got my photo clicked as well. The first game I played on this was Demon’s Soul. Launch remote had drift issues only one month in. Sony Service Centre in Lajpat Nagar promptly replaced it. The replaced remote is function superb even till date. One of my favourite consoles after PS1. It’s fast, efficient and just works. The SSD plays a huge role in making this system feel like a console when cartridges were used. Just plug and play with little to no wait. LOVE IT. 

Currently trying to platinum the new Prince of Persia

2) Television - Sony A80J OLED (55’ inches). Hands down the best television I’ve ever owned or viewed. Was a toss up between this and LG C1. SONY won hands down. Its image processing, colour accuracy and motion handling was way more superior to LG. Plus I prefer Matte screens over glossy. Gaming on it is super fun, 120Hz with VRR is great for COD. Playing Dead Space on Quality Mode at night with headphones was an experience. The only deep blacks add so much to the dread and immersion of the game. 

3) Remotes - 2 Normal Dual Sense/1 Dual Sense Edge. Barring the launch controller which promptly got replaced, the controllers have lasted me very well. Just got the caps replaced for one of them and they’re as good as new. The Dual Sense Edge is superb for a hardcore gamer like me. Love the back buttons and the carrying case it comes with. Top quality stuff. Also have two Replacement Analogue Nubs in reserve. Battery life of the EDGE  though is crap. Fizzles out too quickly for my taste. Quite manageable, but irritating nonetheless. 

4) Sony Official Charging Dock - Does what it says. Very convenient to use and highly recommend for people who have 2 or more controllers. Something about the drop and charge nature of the controller just works. Note - While cleaning the charging dock, never ever press down and expose the pins. The pins are incredibly fragile and will bend. Or else it’s expensive but well built and does what it says. 

5) Logitech G733 Wireless Headphones - Really-Really love them, no complaints. Its comfort is FANTASTIC, sound quality too is good with a nice microphone. Battery wise it has never died on me and is a beast.  Got it for ₹14,000 when Pulse 3D Headphones were retailing in Black for ₹20,000 and had not officially launched in India. Though if I have to buy something today I’ll probably buy the Pulse 3D for 6K or wait for the Pulse Elite Planar Magnetic Headphones. 

6) Sound System - Pair of APPLE HOMEPODS GEN1. Hands down my best purchase. Got them for 15k each during discount. Superb value for 30k combined. Listening to music  is insane on this, ditto for watching films as well. For small to mid sized room, the HomePods are highly-highly recommend. Have connected these to my PS5 via e-Arc and Apple TV 4K. Absolutely NO lag while gaming on the PS5 with these. Game sound incredibly full and rich. Also use it a lot for setting timers and reminders. 

7) Apple TV 4K Latest - Apple TV is a must if you have HomePods. Makes for less wires and everything is wireless.

8) Nintendo Switch Lite - It’s kept inside the cabinet.  My fix for not having a successor to PS VITA. Fantastic console, can’t rave enough about it. The handheld size gives me PS vita vibes which I love. 


9) Table - IKEA - Good storage with inbuilt cable management. Plays a huge role in keeping the setup clean. Can fit a slim power strip inside the back panel.

Hell my brother got a pair of HomePods mini for his room just for using hands free and ease, despite the fact that he has a super pair of Adam Monitors for his singing and music compositions.', 'Thanks man. Would have loved to have a nice TV cabinet/Stand. Unfortunately the Table is kind of a compromise for work.

While viewing content in Dolby-Vision Dark the image gets quite dark but is accurate. For normal SDR the image is very-very bright.', 'What’s your budget bro? Well for Wireless Headphones for PS5, remember that they will only work with PS5 or other devices where you can insert the dongle and have compromised Audio Quality as opposed to wired options for the price. With that disclaimer, if you want Wireless Headphones for sheer convenience and trust me they are convenient, just get the Pulse 3D Headphones during discount period from Amazon. \n\nIf however you have a higher budget, require good sound quality and want headphones which has Bluetooth as well as can link with PS5, then I suggest you to wait for the Pulse Elite Planar Magnetic Headphones.', 'Thank you so much man 👌🏼\n\nUnfortunately HomePods Mini will not do the trick, they are simply too underpowered for Television if you ask me.

G Card- RTX 4070

Storage- 4TB SSD (a must for, brand suggestions welcomed)

PSU-RM1000E

1amjo05,PS5 monitor compatibility,"Hey, I want to purchase a new monitor for my ps5 (no other use) and was thinking of buying either [LG - 27Qn600](https://www.amazon.in/LG-2560-1440-Display-Borderless/dp/B08CF4GK96/ref=sr_1_3?crid=YI3YAUY3HUSH&keywords=1440p%2Bmonitor&qid=1707467109&sprefix=1440p%2Caps%2C214&sr=8-3&th=1) or [LG-24QP550](https://www.amazon.in/LG-IPS-sRGB-Height-Adjust-Display/dp/B0BRQT57RC/ref=sr_1_7?crid=YI3YAUY3HUSH&keywords=1440p+monitor&qid=1707466313&sprefix=1440p%2Caps%2C214&sr=8-7). Both are almost the same other than the size difference. I have a doubt if PS5 have some compatibility requirements for the monitor to work. As these are 1440p monitors I dont want to end up playing on 1080p just because my ps5 didnt recognise the 1440p output or HDR10 compatibility, lol.

If you have any other montior suggestions please let me know. I dont want to spend too much on monitor maybe under 20k just because I am okay with 2k 60 since most of the current gen games are capped at 60fps 2k anyways (ignoring the upscale or dsr) in performance mode (I play on performance, fps are more important than quality lol). My current monitor is a 1080p 21inch no HDR, so couldn’t actually utilise the ps5 potential (even a little).",2024-02-09 08:37:13,"['Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1amhbcn,Acer Nitro XV272U V3: Review,"So, last month I got the acer xv272u v3, since I could not find much reviews/findings on the internet I am trying to help those who are looking to get a WQHD 1440p monitor.

Let's start from the pricing:  


1. **Price**: 19k from amazon(used my amazon pay cc), if you can get it cheaper elsewhere say md or vedant, good for you. For me, 19k was a pretty good deal considering the features and upgrade from 1080p, also, I most probably missed out on the sale so...here's the link: [https://amzn.eu/d/cBSnVSj](https://amzn.eu/d/cBSnVSj)
2. **Display**: Probably the most import factor to lookout for when considering to a buy a new display device. I did my part of surfing around the web to find the best I could get in the range of around 30k. This is probably not the best out there in your opinion, but I did compare the features and it almost stands close to the competitors like *m27q rev 2.0, lg gp850,* etc. I won't go in about the details as to what specs it has but I am linking it from where you can read it for yourself:  [27"" Acer XV272U V3bmiiprx - Specifications (displayspecifications.com)](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/e04e35a6). Okay now coming to the point whether HDR works or not, so the answer is: ***Yes,*** it does. The device has hdr  400 certification but that does not mean it will work coz, it probably needs a higher certification (hdr600 and later). But it has 8 bits + FRC @120Hz, you can try lowering the refresh rate to 120Hz and via nvcp, you will probably see the option to switch from 8bit to 10bit. Attaching the link: [https://imgur.com/a/0YjYcVX](https://imgur.com/a/0YjYcVX) (I do not have any idea about as to how you can do it for amd cards). Also, the monitor supports hdmi2.0 and dp1.2, I am using **DP** and not **HDMI**. On **HDMI**, even on 120hz the 10bpc option isn't available I guess because of the bandwidth being lesser. I could see **8, 10 and 12 on 1440p 60hz on HDMI** though. The colors are no more washed out for me, also from the monitor's osd settings, I am using HDR-400 and colorspace HDR. DCI is good but it enhances the colors too much for me, maybe personal POV. My unit did not have any significant screen bleed apart from the corners which I think is the ips glow (goes away if you look from diff angles). Also, from the osd, try to keep the overdrive setting to ""**off***"",* it was causing smearing for me while -playing games, maybe because of the response time.
3. **Adaptive Sync:** The monitor supports amd free sync premium, so I was able to utilize g-sync from nvcp upon enabling it from osd.
4. **Conclusion**: I haven't faced any issues with this monitor, and I am pretty much satisfied with it for the price point. Also, I did check with my apple tv, the HDR is working in there too, with 4:2:2 configuration and surprisingly at 4k. It seems the panel supports upto 3840\*2160p at 60Hz, I will update this post if I happen to check it with CRU on windows. It most probably would.

Let me know if you need any other clarifications, I might have mixed things up in the display section, but I just wanted to let users know about this specific use case.",2024-02-09 06:01:13,"['Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1adp7ni,LG Oled C2 and C3 pricing,"The thing is, I was looking to buy C2 from LG, 42” for light gaming and movies. Because c4 was releasing this year, I thought c2 would be very cheap. But no sir! The reliance digital near me quoted a figure of 80k. And most others do not have the size I want. 

Now, the thing is I know someone who got c2 for 65k last year and this year he got the c3 for 67k. What I’m not understanding is despite all this information, why isn’t reliance lowering its prices. 

Also, if you guys have bought c2 or the c3, how much did it cost you and where!

19bxlej,i need some help setting up my tv with laptop,"So my parents own a lg oled tv which i sometimes use to play games but i feel like i'm not able to use it to its maximum capability as i have never used a laptop with tv   
so few of my questions are:-

1. i own an asus tuf a15 which doesnt have any mux switch so when i connect it via hdmi i guess it connects via display graphic card idk much about it either but i have heard it reduces the performance so is there any way to fix it 
2. My gpu is not capable of playing at native 4k so is there something else that i must do    
so i im able to play at good resolution without loosing too much fps 
3. like the windows has many option to display over the other screen like duplicate, extend, etc which is the better one  
the hdmi i own is the amazon basic one so does it affects the performance  
",2024-01-21 07:04:37,"[""1. Connecting the HDMI directly to the TV connects via the GPU, so it will boost the performance rather than decreasing it.\n\n2. Yes, the GPU can't run 4K so that's why (contd)\n\n3. Win + P and choose EXTEND DISPLAYS. This will keep the native resolution and run your games on TV smoothly. \nYou might want to check the resolution once after connecting to the TV by going to Settings (Win+I) > Display > Select the display 2 and check the resolution. \n\nAlso check if the game you are playing over the TV screen has the correct resolution set in graphics settings. This is a one time process. You will be able to play everything smoothly then.\n\nYes, even the HDMI cable quality plays an important role. Check for its speed on its package and Google it to see if it's compatible for your use.\n\nAdditional Tip: When you connect the HDMI to TV, select the option of Game Console or PC in the HDMI type (which is there in the TV, depending on brand to brand) , this will decrease the response time and make your display more responsive and smooth. \n\nThat's all."", ""Omg thanks a lot I always used 2nd screen only and was confused why I'm unable to use hdr and my refresh rate was locked too now I'm finally able to use it properly the last time I used extend it only showed me blank screen so I instantly gave up on it and now after setting it up it's running properly thanks again!🙏\nBut there is a small issue my desktop icons are not visible to me"", ""I'm glad it worked! \n\nYeah because extend means that you are extending (increasing the size) of your display, so your icons remain in the main display, but you can drag them to the extended display and keep them there also. \n\nAlso, if you start something on the main display and  want to transfer it to the second display, use Win + Shift + Right/Left arrow\n\nRemember: When you are using your laptop only, and not the second display, it may happen that your icons on TV will not show, so simply turn off extended display by Win + P > PC Screen Only.\n\nAlso, there is one more specific settings which you should take care of... DM me after you read this message, I'll tell you there. \n\nIf you face any more problems, feel free to text me :)""]"

197h772,"When will the new 27"" and 32"" OLED monitors come to the Indian Market?","**Here are the 32"" 4k contenders I have shortlisted:**

1. LG UltraGear 32GS95UE W-OLED (MLA) (matte), pixel sound, 1300nits					

2. Samsung Odyssey QD-OLED G8 (G80SD) 32"" OLED, G80SD (matte)					

3. Dell Alienware 32” 4K QD-OLED 240Hz Monitor = AW3225QF (1800R Curved Glossy)					

4. Asus ROG Swift PG32UCDM QD-OLED = PG32UCDP (later 2024)					

5. MSI 321URX 32"" 4k OLED				

6. HP Omen Transcend 32"" 4k OLED with DP2.1 glossy					

7. Gigabyte AORUS F032U2P DP2.1 glossy

&#x200B;

My requirements are: Flat, Glossy, 32"", 4k, 240Hz, QD-OLED, Preferably DP2.1, not crazy expensive.

  
Asus usually releases very late, and if it comes to India, it will be ridiculously high priced.  
That leaves me with only 5,6,7  


Let me know what you guys think about the release schedule of these monitors in India, as to when it would be possible to buy these with a bank discount from Amazon India or the company website (India version).  


Hope they come under 1.3L.

18y8hzc,Need help in choosing between 65 inch LG C3 and Samsung S90C,"As the title suggests (primary purpose is Gaming)

I am 32, and have understood I am now more of a casual gamer than all nighter FPS and FIFA sessions. So have decide to fulfil my dream of buying an OLED (in the process creating a hole in my pocket). Here are a few additional questions for OLED users.

1. Was the jump to OLED worth it?
2. Any issues like burn-in and other things?
3. Also provide your suggestions based on occasional streaming and sports watching.  


I am getting C3 for 167k and S90C for 140k",2024-01-04 08:46:11,"['Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/WX6jbCD\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is more vivid and brighter. We got 65 S90c during diwali for 155k so u r getting a good deal. With PS5 it's a treat for eyes"", '1. The jump to OLED is easily worth it. I have upgraded various hardware over the last 5 years, but absolutely none of the upgrades had such an impact on the overall gaming experience - it easily has a higher graphical impact than even upgrading your GPU. \n\n2. Theoretically, burn in will always be an issue, but modern day OLEDs have come a long way to minimize the risk. The major issue is that once you go OLED, there is simply no going back :P It puts every other panel type to shame. \n\n3. Head over to /r/OLED_Gaming, you will find many reviews of both these TVs there, and also other options. I think Samsung recently unveiled high refresh rate 4k OLED monitors at CES, so you may want to wait a bit to check them out. But considering the usual mark up in the Indian market, getting an OLED TV may be more VFM. \n\nI bought C2 55"" in July 23, and use it as a monitor for my gaming PC. In 6 months, I have already racked up 1100 hours on it, and this is simply cos gaming is just so much more immersive and enjoyable with such a display.', ""OLED is absolutely worth it. I got a Samsung Frame last year and while it is phenomenal with the QLED being better than normal LEDs, I also saw a C2 as well as an S90B sitting beside it in croma and the picture quality was simply next level. If I was going to game on a TV I'd definitely go OLED.\n\nAs for which one to chose, I honestly feel you can't go wrong with either. You should probably head to a croma or Reliance Digital nearby and compare them side by side and see which one you like more."", 'Hey, did you get the S90C?

18r2kzm,Searching for a new monitor but super confused!,"I’ve been looking for a new monitor as my current one has started showing white lines. 

I am thinking of an ultrawide monitor and came across below options:

- Samsung Odyssey G5 34-inch (32k)
- MSI MAG342CQR 34-inch (32k)
- LG Ultragear 34-inch (35k)
- AOC CU34G3S (35-37k)
- Gigabyte G34WQC A 34-inch (35k)

All of these are VAs which is sad. I really wanted an ultrawide but I am now confused. 

Confused whether should I go ahead with one of the above or switch to 27-inch or 32-inch IPS monitor.

18mtri9,Need suggestions on my new build.,"I'm building this in first week of January. There are just few questions I had.

1. Is this mobo good for this config? Or there are any other good options in same price point? (The totals are already out of my budget by few k, so not considering any costlier components as I might overspend.)

2. Will this cooler be enough for 7600? Or do I really need AIO. (Choose this purely on my preference of having a display inside the case. I know AIO's are good, but with display it'll cost me extra 10k if I buy nzxt kraken. And If this cooler is enough I don't see any need for spending extra few bucks on AIO.)

3. Is this ram compatible? Or is there any other cheaper ram available with amd expo? I'm only considering 32gb 6000MHZ rams. Non RGB if cheaper is preferred.

4. For cabinet I'm considering 2-3 more fans. 1-2 for exhaust at the top. One extra at bottom for intake. With this will my airflow be optimal? And is airflow in ant esport crystal case good?

5. I'm not big fan of RGB's so trying to build a all black pc. Will set only white/light blue/red lights on all the fans/components.

Is there any other change I can make to reduce the cost without loosing performance?

18mrylm,Need a 1440p Monitor for PS5.,"Looking for a 1440p monitor for PS5 with 144Hz refresh rate. Budget is \~₹25000  


* Large size, preferably larger than the desktop monitors. Might wall mount it in the future.
* High refresh rate. (saw that HDMI 2.0 supports 120fps with 144Hz on 1440p monitor.)
* Don't know much about IPS/OLED stuff, so anything pleasant on the eyes is fine.

Saw some options in [LG](https://www.amazon.in/LG-2560x1440-Pixels-IPS-sRGB-Display/dp/B0BRQV14YD/ref=psdc_1375425031_t1_B09DT74LW4) and [ViewSonic (75Hz)](https://www.amazon.in/ViewSonic-VX2780-2K-SHDJ-SuperClear-Ergonomics-connectivity/dp/B09DT6N9K6?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=A146ETXVJJ0YV&th=1), but want a bigger screen.

4K with 144Hz (and HDMI 2.1) are too expensive, so I decided to get 1440p instead.

18l2my7,Recommendations for docking station.,"Hello everyone!

Looking for recommendations for docking stations. For now I've considered the Dell WD19TB.

Any good alternatives to it? Budget will be same as Dell WD19TB (which at the time of writing this post is \~12k)

I'll give an overview of my setup: I have a MacBook Pro M2, Lenovo ThinkPad T16 and Lenovo Legion. The Legion is mostly for gaming and the other two are for work. I'd like to connect my 2 LG Ultragear monitors (2k, FHD) to the laptops for my workflow. Also peripherals like keeb, mouse, external HDDs etc.

Any good recommendations for this workflow?

Please ask any questions if you have regarding my setup in case it'll help with the recommendation.

Thanks!

If you want Macbook Pro M2 to output 2 monitors, please make sure every docking station you are considering adopting DisplayLink Technology. That is the only way (as far as I known) to output multiple extended displays for Macbook with Appple Silicone.  \nPlugalbe, Targus are good company building DisplayLink dcoking station.\n2. Since you have another gaming laptop especially for game, typically there is no docking station for game because the limitation of bandwidth of USB-C cable. Maybe docking station with Thunderbolt 5 may change the situation now.\n\nAccording to your need for gaming, you may take BenQ's hybrid dock DP1310 into your consideration. It is equipped with dual source (USB-C IN & HDMI IN), with this design it could assure the output performance of HDMI IN from been constrained by the bandwidth of USB-C. \n\nBut the shortcoming of DP1310 is that KVM fucntion are not supported between these 2 sources, which means you can not use the same set of keeb/mouse on it. How I overcome the shortcoming is using a keeb/mouse with bluetooth & USB connector. Connect your laptop with bluetooth and connect to your gaming laptop with USB connector."", ""Ah right, I won't be using the docking station to game, although if I'm working on the legion then I might connect it to the docking station.

This success is majorly due to the Jio revolution in India and ease of access of mobile devices. As Indians become more rich in the coming years thanks to the fast growing economy, we can see them excelling in other esports as well.
Btw Tribe gaming were the defending champs who got knocked out this time. Lg were runners up last champs.
I knew from the beginning that this Godlike team had great potential. Their slaying is probably one of the best if not the best, they just needed to work on their tactical play, game sense and closing out games under pressure.

18gtjzx,Help me build my PC with right components,"
I want to build a PC, under 1.25L. My use case is productivity and gaming.
 1. Video editing (4k for 15-30mins) .        Looking to use da vinici .
2.Gaming (60 fps on 1080/1440p is fine) I play story based games and racing games

I wanted to go with 14700k as its perfect for productivity & gaming but on research, i came to know that K series chips run hot and need z790 mobo to work at their max which drives the cost higher. 


So i thought of going with the below build . Is this fine or pls suggest some

Option 1 : 
13600k

64gb ram 3600mhz cl18
Wd sn770 ssd
AK620 air cooler 
3060 12gb 
DQ650 psu

Or wait and save up and go for 

Option 2: 
14700k 
msi z790-P mobo
64gb ram ddr5 6000mhz c36
Wd sn770 ssd 1tb 
Deepcool ls720
3060 12gb 
DQ750 psu

Im just beginning with video editing and will be learning along the way and im not sure if 13600k is enough

Will there be a noticeable difference in using ddr4 for vid editing? 

Please help with your suggestion .

What will you be doing with this PC? -
