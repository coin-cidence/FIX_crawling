14t472g,LG India is extremely incompetent and fraudulent,"I had purchased an OLED TV from their website 17 days back. 2 days after purchase they generated an invoice and their website said it would be delivered within a day. 
Till today, after numerous calls, emails, messages, tweets, not a single person from that god forsaken company has given me the slightest update on the resolution.

They’re not even allowing me to cancel and get a refund.
I even escalated to their MD desk more than a week back and the person managing that side just gives copy paste idiotic responses.
Few days back, I filed the grievance with the consumer forum website and even there these guys are given boilerplate responses.

Today I finally got tired and filed a dispute with my credit card company.
If anyone ever thinks of buying from LG, think again. These people will literally take more than 1 lakh of your hard earned money and run.

140bzpm,Is LG a good brand to go with for air conditioner? (AC recommendation),"Hi everyone, I have finally decided to get an ac for the first time for a 123 sqft room. It will be used primarily during summer and in monsoon for dehumidification. A 1.5ton 3 star should serve me fine I guess.

My first choice was to go with a Daikin. My neighbour has one 1.5ton 3 star and it has been serving just fine.

But this LG ac caught my eye: https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0BQ3MJ1TG. I don't have a high budget so this seems to be a good deal however I'm curious about LG's service, Many people telling it's good.

So what's your experience has been with LG air conditioners? or should I go with Daikin only? My budget is under 35k, can be stretchable to 37k max.",2023-06-04 12:45:31,"[""I would suggest go with Lg 6 in 1 4star, it has pretty good reviews, the service is amazing, super silent. You can't even tell its switched on, very easy on bills.   \n\n\n450w at 40% ... at 27C ... this is 4star ... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got it for 35k with Installation (with stand) and Stablizer. DM if you wish to know the offer(s).   \n\n\nDaikin was like 6k expensive, I mean it is decent no denial. But, the service LG provides in unmatched.   \n\n\nIn my 4-tier town ... it was delivered in 2 days (Flipkart) and installed the very next day."", ""I have 5 ac in total in my two flats. \nThey are LG, 2 Panasonic, Voltas, Daikin.\n\nDaikin is good but they did not use to give warranty on pcb board. My pcb board malfunctioned and had to replace it with Rs. 6000. Now Daikin provides a warranty of 5 years on pcb. Most Daikin acs are limited in tech and features but they do the job well. Service is also good but parts availability is kind of a crisis right now.\n\nLG is very good. Service is good. Power consumption is ok. Silent. Technically more advanced than all. Note that LG is one of the only brands that have inhouse ac technicians and don't hire third party for servicing. \n\nPanasonic comes in 2nd place. I had an indoor unit leakage issue. But later it was discovered that the installation guys did not fix the water outflow pipe correctly and they identified the problem incorrectly as indoor unit issue. So indoor unit was perfectly fine. All in all panasonic is pretty nice. But costlier than Daikin. If you want your room to get ice cold really fast, panasonic is the way to go. It's very powerful. \n\nVoltas, well what can I say. Worst installation, worst service, and quality is not good. \n\n\nWhich ac to buy? Whatever you have an offer on from the first 3 and check if service is available in your locality. \n\n\nYou can also consider Samsung. Latest ac models from Samsung are also quite nice.\n\nI have heard mixed reviews about Hitachi. So not sure about that. \n\nPeople shout out about Japanese brands. To them, sir all these acs are manufactured in India. Just because the brand is Japanese doesn't mean you will get the quality of Japanese acs."", 'LG is known to sell reduced power AC with higher rating. Further Daikin AC are super silent.

13i6s3m,My Rant about LG and their *own technicians*,"Just bought my AC today. And I had to file a complaint today only. And don't get me wrong, I hate to be that ""I would like to talk to your manager"" karen type of guy. But the situation was worse than I expected. I bought LG primarily because they are just supposed to provide the best service. With that, let's see what happened -

1. They don't have their own trained technicians with uniforms like you would expect. They also outsource local technicians.

&#x200B;

2. They don't do clean installation. I don't know if this is a thing in big cities only, but in mine they certainly did a horrible job.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ik3u1u3xlzza1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fdc004e28764cdccfc0fcd570643df04dd2d998

3. They are rude and try to gaslight you. Mine asked me for the satisfaction code company provides us, and when I confronted him by asking him to do the installation first, he said ""Do you consider us theives"". I still held back and gave them the code that time. Ironically, they ran away like thieves after doing the bare minimum. Didn't install my stabilizer and mcb after the confrontation. Take a look at the photos, do you expect me to turn on the AC with a hanging wire?

https://preview.redd.it/hw7yebiumzza1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bee9ec64c413e3f61a6b3b2b245199b8a97b653c

Unfortunately, they messed with the wrong guy and I reported them to LG. LG did send a new technician right away who did a fantastic job, so I have to give LG credit for that. The new guy also installed stand for the AC.

https://preview.redd.it/s8t0joj8nzza1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e0dc92f83222b7807da0f7ec7a9c4c86b9da8a7

All I want to say is no brand has exceptionally good service, everybody outsource their technicians and it's just a matter of luck what type of technician you get. But you can do two things, don't give them the satisfaction code unless your work is done no matter what. And report them to the company if you have any complaints.",2023-05-15 12:25:59,"['* Your post title should be an accurate summary of your text post.
