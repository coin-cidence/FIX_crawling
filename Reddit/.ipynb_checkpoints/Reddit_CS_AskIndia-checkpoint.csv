1evwqqr,LG AC Service: Scam?,"A month before my warranty ran out, I noticed a drop in the cooling performance and called LG Service. They cleaned the air filter, claimed that the poor performance was because of that, and vanished. I was still unsatisfied, but they kept giving one excuse or the other.

Now, 3 months later, just after warranty expired, I called them and they say that the gas pressure is very low, just 20% of what it should be. And want to charge 4000 for refilling the gas. Or buy an AMC.  

Looks like a well orchestrated scam to me: the pressure just drops from 100% to 20% within 3 months, right after the warranty expires.",2024-08-19 08:36:36,"[""Just file a grievance with online consumer forum attaching the original complaint and rectification offered and current complaint. In future always send mails to given email along with phone calls. Because in such scams unless you have proof you don't get relief. And does gas pressure come under warranty? I don't believe it does. Just check with LG. Usually only manufacturing complaint comes under warranty."", ""Yo're right that I don't have proof, just a hunch. Seems too much of a coincidence that gas runs out immediately after warranty.  \n\nAll gadget manufacturers are nowadays desperate to sell AMCs."", ""They are. And AMCs make sense for a lot of customers. If you want closure then just check if warranty covers gas pressure. And since you are out of warranty I would definitely advice hiring a third party to do the work. Gas filling shouldn't cost 4k.""]"

1d4t4fz,Is it reliable to buy ac online???,"I live in a village near a tier 2 city in Gujarat. I visited multiple shops offline as well as checked online and found 4 brands of ac to be attractive: Daikin, bluestar, Hitachi, LG.
