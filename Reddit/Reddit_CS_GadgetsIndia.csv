1emdwbk,Help me choose a TV in 55/65 in (Samsung/Sony/LG) Budget 65k-90k with slight flexibility ,"I am planning to buy a TV mainly for movies and gaming. With plethora of options mainly across the 3 brands I am somewhat confused.  

Between Samsung Crystal series (65k), LG QNED83SRA(80k, 120 Hz), Sony Bravia 3 (90k) Sony Bravia X82 series. 

Another confusion is getting a 55 OLED or high end TV compared to 65 regular 4k LED TV? What do you guys suggest?",2024-08-07 14:55:24,"['Get the 55""OLED rather than regular 65"" LED TV.\nAnd I\'d prefer in this order.\n\nSony > LG > Samsung.', 'I have also heard about OLED burn-in issues. How prevalent is that? Only LG model is offering 120 refresh rate in 80k price so need to take that into consideration. Sony regular LED would be costing 80k', ""Yes. Sony's Regular TVs cost almost 50% more than LG or Samsung's regular LED TV. Same with OLEDs too. But trust me Sony is the best when it comes to Picture Quality among these three whether it is OLED and Regular LED. You can also go for LG. LG has the best customer service among these three in India. Don't know about Sony's customer service because there hasn't been any issue with my sony products ever since I bought them. Try to get it during sale, companies usually offer extended warranty. And make sure it's the company who's offering extended warranty not the retail store.\n\nAnd yes OLEDs can have burn in issues. But that only occurs when there's a constant picture like a channel logo or something displayed constantly at the same place on screen for multiple days. But I doubt you'll watch cable channels on an OLED Tv for longer periods. And I don't remember which one among these three but one of them also has a technology to combat that, forcefully move that channel logo to left or right so that it can prevent burn in issues. But I think that comes in their premium flagship TVs, nothing under 1 Lac. You can look it up if you want. \n\nYou have to take extra care of it I guess. Higher the cost, higher the maintenance."", 'Thanks a lot for detailed answer. \n\nI am thinking of going with Sony in that case.

And try to reach out to them and ask their customer support if it has been actually discontinued or not. \n\nAnd try to wait for sale if possible. You'll get better deals then."", 'Yes, at present 15 Aug sale is going on in Amazon, giving 10k card+coupon discount.

There's risk for burn-in too and as for warranty also yes, LG even for their OLED TVs in India have reduced warranty for many showroom models from 3 years to 2 years. You have the ability to buy additional 2 years of warranty though by paying like 15-20k extra for a 55 inch model or at least's what was quoted to me by a salesman in Croma showroom."", 'Well thanks for inputs, I will consider it.\xa0', ""Well off and Upper middle class people do buy 4K TV's (some on EMI's) but the lower middle class still cannot afford to spend that amount of money just for the premium-ness.

A decade ago, the CPU's were built on the 22nm architecture, today we get CPU's with 10nm architecture. Some chips with as small as 3-4nm architecture.\n\nIn a decade, you will see the market surge with cheap OLED TV's when everyone is using Apple Vision Pro or something similar.\n\nIn India, people care the most about the budget. They don't care if they get a 5 star AC by just paying 8-9k extra. They end up buying the 3 star AC which costs quite more than the 5 star AC in its lifetime.\n\nPeople here end up buying cars with no NCAP just because they don't crumple on accidents (like TATA). Sure if a person has budget they will buy the 4K tv, but a person who just wants a TV (restricted by budget), will go with a FHD or 2K one."", '4K TVs are inexpensive right now!

As for 1440p they don\'t even make televisions with this resolution and it\'s mostly used for computer monitors (and 1440p right now is the most popular standard especially in gaming!). \n\nUnlike a lot of other gadgets and electronics, Televisions like I\'ve said have almost become like commodities. They don\'t cost a lot and a cheap 4K TV today costs just 20,000 rs and at most 25,000 rs! That isn\'t a very big amount for people who expect it to last at least half a decade! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ea987YO-vCI\n\nThere\'s a better explanation by a 3 year old video by Techquickie on that topic (sister channel of Linus Tech Tips on Why TVs are SO CHEAP!). \n\nAs for the lower middle class, manufacturers [even in India] aren\'t just going to target this segment of demographic alone! There\'s going to be multiple segments for nearly EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT. From smartphones to watches to refrigerators to televisions and smartphones and heck even something like a toothbrush! People are gonna buy mid range goods as much as ultra budget/low cost goods and that applies even to things such as clothes, fashion & lifestyle products! \n\nThe point is options to do exist for thousands of goods but when it comes to cheap 27 - 32 inch OLED displays there isn\'t one like they do with sooo many options with LCD monitors. We\'ve got TN panels, IPS panels, VA panels. Monitors with 90hz, 120hz, 144hz, 240 hz refresh rates all selling from as low as 5000 rs to 30000 rs range with sizes as low as 19 inch to as high as 40"".

1e6gh0u,Never buy MiTV,"I'll make it short and quick. 

These TVs die right after the warranty period ends, sometimes before if you're lucky but they are not made fo last long. The service Centre guys ask 45000 to repair a 55000 rupees TV

Further the service Centre guys offered to replace the back light (which was the issue with mine), for 15,000. The picture is what they delivered after the repair. It's dead in the exact same pattern as before, which means they did not replace the panel amd still charged 15000 rupees. 

Lesson learned, always buy from LG, Sony or Samsung, none of this hisense, tcl, realme, mitv stuff. 

This TV has never worked right, first one arrived with a broken panel, second one died within warranty period and that took like 3 months to replace. This 3rd one died after a few months of usage. And now it's gonna visit service center for the 4th time. ",2024-07-18 17:04:58,['Even I faced the same problem']

micromax and xolo died before getting asus, while asus died 1 month after getting lg g8x ( asus 2 time display change also third time broken display, swollen battery).     
the lg g8x dropped more time than all 3 phone combined, only back glass cracked when dropped rugged mud road without case . 99% time used with case. the phone more often switch off while the charge is around 15-20%.  
i use the phone continuously more than 12hrs daily, charge full charge twice normally more while used game.   
mainly web browsing, youtube and multimedia streaming in 4g data all the time now last 1.5 year 30-50% in wifi.  
also have network issues which need flight mode or even restarting.   
  
before asking above question decided poco x6 pro, nord ce 4 according to the payment and card offer at the time of purchase. will try to add in the list nord 4 after tomorrow  launch event and its offer.   
  
also wanted to give it a try for a35/a34 (for software update and nearby service center than performance decided against for performance , wanted to try a55 but too costly)  
  
nothing 2a and pixel skipped due to service center availability and time taken for service also network problems.

- 10-Core GPU
- 8GB Unified Memory
- 256GB SSD Storage

**Price:** ₹59,999 (Not sure if the student discount will apply)

**Here's what I'll be using it for:**

**Study:**
- Reading PDFs
- Creating projects & assignments

**Work:**
- Google Sheets
- Facebook Ads
- Slack

**Enjoy:**
- Watching movies & web series

3. Any suggestions for alternatives or upgrades?
