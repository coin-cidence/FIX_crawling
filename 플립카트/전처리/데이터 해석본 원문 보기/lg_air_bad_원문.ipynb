AC has been delivered on 2nd of June but No service engineer is coming for installation even after the elapse of 1 month. Customer care executives are non cooperative. It is not worth buying.

My AC delivered on time but they didn't have a good brand authorised partner in Hyderabad so that my installation was not done for a week which is bad. I had wasted my time and money by believing their promised date of installation everyday. If you are planning to get this one Flipkart, I would suggest not to do that.   \n",

AC has been delivered on 2nd of June but No service engineer is coming for installation even after the elapse of 1 month. Customer care executives are non cooperative. It is not worth buying. I will rate it 0 star   \n",

My Ac delivered on 1st june and till now no installation done. Many follow up done by my side but no result. Flipkart team only giving fast comment daily. If someone want same pain which I get then go ahead or take another option.   \n",

AC has been delivered on 2nd of June but No service engineer is coming for installation even after the elapse of 1 month. Customer care executives are non cooperative. It is not worth buying. I will rate it 0 star   \n",

My Ac delivered on 1st june and till now no installation done. Many follow up done by my side but no result. Flipkart team only giving fast comment daily. If someone want same pain which I get then go ahead or take another option.   \n",

My AC delivered on time but they didn't have a good brand authorised partner in Hyderabad so that my installation was not done for a week which is bad. I had wasted my time and money by believing their promised date of installation everyday. If you are planning to get this one Flipkart, I would suggest not to do that.   \n",
