BEST EVER PURCHASE
9 MONTHS AGO
I brought it from Flipkart in Diwali and I am very happy from this purchase because it is a decent product for genuine use, also its performance is very smooth and nice. I would recommend everyone to buy this in a sale or after a card discount. #A decent and genuine product from a brand
