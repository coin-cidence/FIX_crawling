GREAT PRIZE, PRODUCT QUALITY, DELIVARY PROCESS
2 MONTHS AGO
Before purchase product I visited offline store same product cost was very high. After that I visited LG website they gives me best market prize and all process was very smooth. Also they deliver my machine to my home in 3 days. Overall experience was very great. Also product is very good and value for money. Thanks LG.
