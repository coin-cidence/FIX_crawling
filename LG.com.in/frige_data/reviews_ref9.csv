POWER SAVING, SIMPLE DESIGN
2 MONTHS AGO
This product looks like Almirah rather than Superior fridge. Aesthetic are comprised, doesn't feel the quality and luxury feel. Looks dirty due to thin film on the main door. Pocket handle is not engineered well that we feel when fridge is loaded. Inside glass are seems to be thin and very much transparent. No provision for adjustment of inner glass panels except one. Pulling handle of vegetable box is kept very low. Fridge also need rear side adjustment stands apart from wheels. Power cable is short need to be another half metre. One best thing is it saves your electricity as it is a 3 star category. Need more attractive external features,curves are missing, smoothness like earlier models is missing. I am not sure why they design shiny steel and protected with thin film. I asked not to remove the film. Then how can I feel the beauty of my fridge.

EXCELLENT REFRIGERATOR BUT WITH BAD PACKING
A YEAR AGO
I purchased this product from LULU, Y Mall, Triprayar, Thrissur, Kerala. The product is excellent but the thermocol packing inside used to protect from dents is flimsy and the external cardboard box is thin. The refrigerator is prone to get dented during transportation due to poor packaging. I received dented refrigerator on delivery (both upper and lower doors were dented). LG should pack the product using thick thermocol with hard external cardboard box to prevent denting. - Ramesh C M
