WORST REFRIGERATOR FROM LG
2 YEARS AGO
We bought this model from ""LG Show room"" 5 months ago. Within 2 months got Door cooling issue. Registered a complaint and was serviced by LG authorized service centre Technician. After 3 months now the Refrigerator is not cooling. Lodged service request again and was told by service technician Fan and Board packed up. Within 6 months period multiple issues occurred. Don't know how long will sustain. After warranty period we have to empty our pocket to service. Not a recommended product from ""LG"".
