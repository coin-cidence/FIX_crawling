DECENT ENOUGH
2 MONTHS AGO
I have been using it for over a month now. The AC is decent. But it lacks in a few places. Like no Wifi connection. Cooling is slow as well as low compared to other better brands which is disappointing because it takes a long time to cool even a small 115 sqft room. The AC is decent looking, classy and remote is pretty good, better than most brands.
