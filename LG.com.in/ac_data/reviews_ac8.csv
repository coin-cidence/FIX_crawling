GREAT FEATURES AND EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY
4 MONTHS AGO
This is a really good AC from LG. The product really has all the necessary features it claims to have. Very easy to operate. Cools room very efficiently and quick. In Sleep mode there is almost no sound of the AC operating in between 24°C-27°C (I have tried myself) in 1.5 ton mode. It has auto cleaning function as well. LG service engineers are so good, skilled and trained. Best AC MODEL
