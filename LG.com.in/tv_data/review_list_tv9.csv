GREAT TV, NOT SO GREAT SMART TV
A YEAR AGO
WebOS sucks. it is laggy, lacks software support (Hotstar etc). HDR10 Pro is not a real thing.

WORTH TO BUY
A DAY AGO
I brought this tv a month ago and it's a good decision to buy this for the price I got for 34k. Only problem is there is a lag in changing the apps.

AWESOME PRODUCT. JUST GO FOR IT.
2 YEARS AGO
Its been 1 week and as a tester I tried every possible connectivity like Game console, Laptop, Set-Top Box, OTTs with internal and External Speakers (LG X-Boom) both. Trust Me, This one is the best you can get in this price range. Very fine 4k scaling and extraordinary sound. Very smooth experience via magic remote. Only thing which i think is not upto the mark is Internet Speed. It goes max upto 70 MBps and refuse to connect to 5G wifi. But not a big issue 60-70 MBps is capable to run any think. eArc is a big Plus. Thanks LG for this super product. I Loved it. :)

GREAT TV TO BUY SETOP BOX CONTENT AS WELL A ONLINE
A YEAR AGO
The tv i bought is a 55 inch variant and picture quality is great brightness level is also good i mean its enough to enjoy hdr content had a very deep dive in other available products from various new brands in india like mi hisense vu and one plus but i was little too worried about their after sale services as we all know these tvs are new to the indian market specially its really bad experience when it comes to tear 2-3 cities so made up my mind to go for branded tvs and lg is the best for offline purchase and after sale services so far so good expirience bought it and installed it the same day even after buying the product late in the evening engineers installed the product without any long weighting and followups within an hour i installed my tv and enjoying the stunning big size with a great viewing experience . Thanks LG to make this festive season happy for my family . thumbsups to the tv you can definitely buy ….just go for it…
