GREAT REFRESH RATE AND PICTURE
A MONTH AGO
I bought this tv 65g4 just because of 144hz refresh rate... because my OLED samsung 65s95d refresh rate was not up to the mark in gaming that why I cancelled the bill of 65s95d and book 65g4...but but but not just this tv is better than in gaming refresh rate also in picture which is comes with Dolby vision, sound, mmrc remote, gallary design personalized picture wizard every thing is better...I feel proud of my selection. Please if you are reading my comment don't confuse or hesitate about this product. Just go and buy... just buy
