STAY AWAY FROM THESE TVS
2 DAYS AGO
Never buy LG LED tv. They use cheap parts which will have issues within some months. I had purchased 2 times and both times tv didn't last more than 2 years. Just now I have 43' LED tv from LG which has panel issue but LG is not able to resolve the issue. Stay away from LG tvs.

GREAT VIEWING EXPERIENCE
9 MONTHS AGO
Happy with overall performance, mind you it's an online only model with only year warranty, If you extend the warranty to 3years (platinum package of 2years) add cost of magic remote, it will cost exactly same as offline store model UR7550, So make up your mind whether you need 1 year warranty of UR7500 or 3 year warranty of UR7550, choose carefully

ITS A FUN TV.
A YEAR AGO
I like LG TVs. One of the best. This one is no different. The picture quality is awesome for the price. The sound quality is alright. It comes with a 4 way wall mount. The bezels are thin, at least the part which is plastic. The OS is smooth though some some lag is there in running the Disney+, JioCinema and Zee5 app. Youtube, prime video and Netflix rjns great.

GOOD FEATURES AT REASONABLE PRICE
16 DAYS AGO
Brought this TV a month ago and satisfied with the outcome of my purchase Good picture quality, Sound quality is better, Ease of use is simple. However the remote is not that good, its responsiveness is very slow, i have purchased another remote and this is very good compared to LG original remote. You can go for this for better picture and ok sound quality . I would recommend buying a Dolby atmos soundbar which is best suited for sound.

HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE
6 MONTHS AGO
got this on sale. priced similar to the TCL 55"" and i think the quality so far after 4 days is quite good. the processor is a bit slow at times. but it's able to stream most things quite well. the panel is satisfactory also. Just upgraded from Sa 10 year old amsung LCD 55"" and the connectivity is much better with the LG. so far so good.

RELEASE OF BONDS WITH THE BRAND MACHINE AGAIN
3 MONTHS AGO
When I bought it, I had a bad experience with my old LG phone. But that's quite a long lifespan. Coming to this device, the first touch was the remote control that won my heart from the beginning. Coming to the device, the sound system, color, clarity make you love to open and look at it.
