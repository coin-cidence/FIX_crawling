VOICE COMMAND DOES NOT WORK
10 MONTHS AGO
I bought this TV a month ago and since then the voice commands are not working and LG customer service told me that the software only understand Korean English. Its a waste if you are some one who use voice command frequently. The picture quality is super but the whole experience goes for toss because of the voice command issues

FEATURE RICH!
8 MONTHS AGO
C3 provides a fantastic viewing experience in an OLED, the HDR and Dolby Vision capabilities of the TV is truely amazing. I bought the TV a days ago, went with the 55 inch model. Confused b/w S90C and C3, but the reliable service and 3 year warranty is a game changer.
