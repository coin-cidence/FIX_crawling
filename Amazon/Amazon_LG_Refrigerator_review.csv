They aren't customer centric what they used to be. I purchased LG refrigerator, it was delivered by Amazon cloud tail delivery team. The couple of guys brought my shipment at 11.00 hrs when i was in midle of offical work, they just placed the item and scanned the product and politely asked the OTP no. Since I had high regards with Amazon brand and trusted them they don't deliver the items with damaged condition so i just shared the OTP with them. Those guys havent performed open delivery which they supposed to do in front of the customer. They might aware this was already damadged before it's out for delivery. Exactly afterb1 hour I just opened the boxes then I found there is a significant dent on the rear side of the refrigerator, I was so terrified and initiated thebl replacement also contacted the customer servixe, explained him about the issue. The CS guy who keep on talking about the process and refused to replacement or refund, again I spoke to his higher offical, he was also spoke about the process, doesn't understand the pain from the common man point of view. I just told him if it is a open inspection delivery, the respective delivery guys has to open the box in front of us and get it signed by the customer also the service quality team has to physically checked the shipment and ensure everything is perfect before it gets out for delivery. I am sure nothing had been happend either. I was so frustrated with the service quality from Amazon my 5 years association with Amazon has been gone for toss. They weren't reliable what they used to be. As the brand going bigger on the other hand they were slipped from the great customer experience. They might colected feedbacks and photographs, it looks like most of them who purchased this item reported silimar issues however they didn't do any alternative solution to avoid this issue. My honest feedback is don't buy it from Amazon. I just spotted the dent and dont know how is going to work."

After raising complaint, LG technician came and he was not able to understand that fridge is making rattling sound every few hours. He did inspection, didn't do anything, and said noise will be gone(its my guarantee). He was not even able to understand what the problem is, even after telling him 4 times. Only 3 hours later, we heard the loud noise again and again.
Technician is not responding now and we've raised the issue again. Hoping some trained technician comes for inspection this time.

This rattling sound is like someone drilling in the wall. It's a known issue with LG fridges(you can find it on Google), but we didn't know it'll be so loud that we'll hear it in the entire flat. Totally disappointed with LG product and service. They are ruining their name by making products like this üëé

Update: After speaking to 4 technicians, sending them audio recording of noise, showing them a video from YouTube where same noise is coming from back of the fridge - they are not able to understand the issue and they are saying it's normal. Due to lockdown, they asked me to cancel the complaint and raise it again after lockdown. Let's see what they do after lockdown!

Update: After lockdown, new technician came. He said you need to adjust a coil which is behind the fridge and sound will be gone. But it's still the same. Don't know why they don't understand( or accept) that fridge has some manufacturing defect. I guess we will have to live with this sound making piece of garbage."

When the product is not sold then only discount is given continuously. After finding maxi discount I bought it but it was a big mistake. This product has very less capacity. And the most problematic is its cooling problem. Within 10 months the product created trouble. It has no cooling. The service man came and changed the cooling control device. Even then no improvement. Then again I made second complaint. They changed the fan. But again same problem. Then again they changed the fan. Then now it is working. It took five days to get it repaired. The service man suggested to purchase the four year warranttee for the product as the parts of the product are costly. I purchased the four years warranttee for the product of Rs 7200 for 20% discount. Now my cost of the product increases to Rs 25000 plus rs 7200 . Around rs 32000. The product is not worth of this price. There are other product in which there is hardly in problem. So I advise not to buy it even if available in 50% discount. Moreover, I think service man intentionally created trouble in maintenance and reflected as if the problem may occure in future, so that I buy the warranty for four years. It was a trap. They fooled me. Now the same warranty is provided in 45% discount."

However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when the fridge stopped working just 48 hours after delivery. Despite following all the installation instructions and ensuring a proper power supply, the appliance is entirely non-functional. It is evident that the refrigerator is defective and, unfortunately, has failed to serve its intended purpose.

My primary reason for purchasing this fridge was to ensure the hassle-free preservation of groceries, especially perishables such as fruits, vegetables, and ice creams. The unexpected breakdown of the fridge has not only caused immense frustration but also led to the wastage of my groceries. In total, I estimate the cost of the wasted items to be around 2000 rupees, which is a significant hole in my pocket. This is far from the experience I anticipated when purchasing a brand-new product through Amazon Prime."

Highly disappointed. I purchased a LG 260 3 Star refrigerator. After 10 days compressor noise so badly . I complain on 26th june to the LG customer care they came on 27th june they said u have to change the compressor I told them to replace the refrigerator they said u have to talk to Amazon customer care I talk to them they said ur replacement date is on 26th we can‚Äôt help you on this I talk to them 2 days but they can‚Äôt be able to help me out for this well. I want to return the product and tried to reach out to Amazon. However the issue is not yet resolved. Such a waste of money buying electronic item on Amazon.

After that he found issue in main motherboard and now changed that too. Not sure why product comes in market without proper testing. Even not sure is this because of online product.

The freezer fan has malfunctioned twice within one year, and it had to be replaced both times. I suspect that LG has designed the refrigerator to stop working after the warranty period, so that they can charge high fees for servicing and replacement.
They are charging 500 for service charge and 3000 for freezer fan replacement, even after replace, freezer getting spoiled again after 3months. Worst refrigerator ever. Stay away from LG. Non popular brands refrigerators working fine than this LG ONES."

This company doesn't care about customer. I bought this fridge about 3 months back now I have it tray which the plastic frame has broken.

If the glass part was broken I would have accepted that okay it is my problem however in this case they must have used substanted quality raw materials materials.

The service support guy called and challenged saying that no fibre parts are covered under warranty it is written under the terms and conditions it seems. It felt like he was trained by the LG to say this because LG knows that they have used substandard product

He even had the audacity to challenge me to write in Amazon or Flipkart or in evening Twitter accounts he knows that the company has told him to do this.

Because we are in India where these companies can do whatever they want if they are write anything in terms and conditions

Please stay away."

I will give 3 STAR for amazon because at least I had an option to return , but amazon should take little more effort because these scratches or not new , it looks very old so you would have seen it before sending it to me ...Now a days it hurt's a lot when making bad decisions or get cheated (just cry no lol), that's why writing review's.. hope it helps some one ..."

Also the rubber tubing is so poor in quality that it has developed holes leading to fungus formation over it during rains despite regular cleaning of fridge.
They know only one way to repair the fridge which is to fill the coolant gas and have charged 3000 rs till now just to fill and refill the gas over a two year period.
5 months since the purchase of the fridge frost formation was seen in the freezer (this fridge is supposedly frost free). The repair guy says no issue with the fridge as the fridge continues to work WTH.
6 months later the fridge stopped working and they filled the coolant gas. The fridge started making noise 5 mins once and frost formation was found near compressor tube. The service guy did gas refills 4 times, frosting stopped but noise did not. He suggested a change of compressor and the compressor was changed. Yet the noise never stopped and the complaint was closed
After a year and half from the change of compressor the fridge stopped working completely. It took us 10 calls to the customer service and an escalation mail to get the service guy to declare that he would have to take the fridge to workshop to do an autopsy of that dead crap and identify where the fault lies. We waited for 10 days for the senior engineer (the only guy who knows atleast something about the fridge) to look into it and we have been asked to wait for 4 days just for the pick up of the fridge.
If this is not HARASSMENT THEN what Is? NO MORE LG.
BEWARE BUYERS.
Wtr to the rubber tube the service guy told us lies that he had ordered a new tube, without placing any such order and charged us money in advance, closed the complaint and repeated the lie when asked after a month. Look at the audacity.
also we had to throw a washing machine from LG within 5 years of its purchase.
If this is the kind of service provided in a metro like Chennai. Just imagine how these guys will cater to other remote locations."

He left a lots of plastic, paper and thermocol pieces littered all over the house and just walked away without a word. He did not even handover the stamped warranty card. I have never seen such a callous workman employed by an MNC. He should be summarily dismissed from the services.

I wanted a fridge with convertible freezer (LG GL-T292RASN, Amber Steel).
This product (GL-I292RPZL, Shiny Steel) is wrongly placed along with the convertible fridge at the same webpage of Amazon MISLEADING ME INTO BUYING THIS believing that both have the same technical specifications.
The discrepancy was identified only when engineer came to install it and he told that this fridge is not convertible.
When I called Amazon to report about it. Initially their representative insisted that both the models had same technical specifications. That is, it took me time to make him understand that both the products were different in technical specifications, and one model was CONVERTIBLE, while the other one was NOT CONVERTIBLE.
After keeping me on hold for a few minutes, he started blaming me instead that I should have verified the technical details myself before placing order.
And that now they would not entertain my request to return / replace my request to rectify the discrepancy . I have tried to click return on the product under my orders, but nothing seems to be happening.
I don't know what to do now in order to get the right product that I need (LG GL-T292RASN, Amber Steel) instead of (GL-I292RPZL, Shiny Steel) which I was mislead into ordering believing that it was of the same technical specs as the former, as both are on the same webpage of amazon."

Compressor is filled with oil which is critical to its operation. In the normal upright position gravity keeps the oil in the compressor. When we lay the refrigerator flat, some of the oil can leave the compressor and go into the cooling lines. The oil is a thick viscous fluid and can clog the cooling lines thus hampering the refrigerator's ability to cool. Lack of oil in the compressor can also damage the compressor.

A fridge should not place like a coffin box, causes blockage in compressor. Its a very bad experience and never seen in my lifetime like that. 3 days after lg people came for demo, they did a good job."

From the start, there was a water leakage. After confirming, that its a persistent leakage, we registered a complaint in just one month, September 2021. The Engineer visited, diagnosed the problem to faulty condenser. There was a followup visit where he tried to replace the original condenser with another design meant for another model. He couldn't explain why the condenser of different design with poor fitment is replaced in place of same model. However, he acknowledged that the product design seems faulty.
There were several visits by service engineers after that, where once there was cooling issue where gas was refilled then another time the fridge body was getting overheated, so again several pipes were cut and issue was resolved. The product kept troubling us and then in May 2022, it entirely stopped cooling. The complaint was raised and this time the fault was with compressor, which was replaced. Again several pipes were cut.
Now we have a one year old fridge which has been repaired several times with several pipe cuts by service engineers, both the primary parts(compressor and condensor) replaced. Additionally the condenser belongs to another model and can't even fit properly in this model.
This clearly shows a faulty product delivered to us.
The fridge is troubling us again for past one month.
I am not able to understand, who is at fault?
Is it the LG design team, which produced an incompatible product so condenser replacement with a different model was needed. Or is it the quality team that let an inferior product pass through which needed multiple repairs and replacements in the first year itself. Or is it the service team, who visited us many many times, leaving a fridge with several pipe joints and both main parts replaced.

I have again raised this request for LG's attention.
Will update the review, if there is any change."

391,"LG 322 L 3 Star Frost-Free Smart Inverter Double Door Refrigerator (2023 Model, GL-S342SDSX, Dazzle Steel, Convertible with Express Freeze)",Reviewed in India on 8 June 2024,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not good - poor build quality and high moisture issue,"I have been using this fridge for about a month and I am not happy with it.

Pros: Reasonably spacious, decent space organization, got it at a big discount

Cons:

1) The build quality is very poor - the plastics, the body - all are very flimsy and low quality. There is no weight to the door and additionally just before being fully shut, there is a weird resistance which causes the door to remain unclosed often, if not carefully fully closed by pushing the door fully shut. No refrigerator that I have had till now had this problem. The plastic used in the trays and compartments is very flimsy. There is no sturdiness to them and they feel cheap.

2) There is a problem of excessive moisture being developed in the fridge even after making sure no vent is being blocked by items inside, having adequate space between the fridge and the wall on all its sides, and setting the temperature of the two sections (the main compartment and the freezer) as instructed. This is causing food items to have a foul smell of the fridge (damp and unpleasant smell) - which is totally unacceptable and highly disappointing from a brand-new fridge from such a reputed brand. Even after being disappointed by the bad build quality, I was hoping that at least the electronic part of the fridge would be good because that is the most important part but unfortunately even that has this problem.

I always use LG products and my experience so far before this fridge was spotless and excellent. All their products that I have used over the years were wonderful. This refrigerator is a big exception and a disappointment. I regret buying an LG fridge and wish that I would have bought a Samsung. My 9 year old Samsung fridge is still working much better. However, I understand that it was a matter of luck that I bought this particularly bad model. I am sure that LG - being the fantastic company that it is - makes good refrigerators and this is just an exception and a bad model. I would not recommend this model at all."

This fridge was bought in May 2021. Within a year a little ice started forming in the freezer section. But that gradually increased. To my misfortune when I finally called the LG customer care it was just over a year. I was told that the warranty was for only a year on the fridge and 10 years on the compressor. After registering a complaint I had to follow up with the mechanics for 2 weeks before someone turned up. I was charged Rs 750, for the mechanic to tell me that the rubber lining could be faulty. He turned it around and left. The problem still continues and no one has yet come to attend to the fridge. It's frustrating to know after shelling out Rs 35k you are still stuck with a faulty piece."

We scheduled this shipment for 2nd because we weren‚Äôt home, so the executive took it back. BUT MARKED THE SHIPMENT AS DELIVERED. Now calling amazon and bluedart daily to figure out where the shipment is. Daily there is a promise of a call back with an update, daily there are no call backs. Prime membership is a waste. No priority resolution is being provided. My sincere suggestion is to never opt for a scheduled delivery because Amazon will never take responsibility for it. I don‚Äôt know the condition in which this fridge is stored at the moment, whether there‚Äôd be an visible damage, dents etc on it when finally delivered. So much anxiety and unnecessary calls being placed daily. Better to get it from a local store. Will never order large items from Amazon ever again."

They look a lovely refrigerator, made is quieter - extra points for that, took away all color options and stuck to a bland silver, and here's the double whammy - they removed all the slots for putting the shelves!

If you want to change the spacing - which is pathetic by the way - large spaces at the bottom which cannot be divided at all, there's no way of working around it other than using some stackable boxes. No flexibility at all.

Secondly, unfortunately we didn't realise this when we went to buy the fridge (bought it elsewhere, so it was really bad inspection on our part but we never had these issues before so didn't know better) - the door does NOT close automatically! This apparently is a very 'smart' feature now applicable in all new LG refrigerators. If you gently close the fridge door, it will stall at half closed, and not close automatically.

Thirdly, they take your health very seriously. Taking out the vegetable tray will mean literally bending all the way to the floor - the opening handle is at the very bottom! Genius design, as I mentioned. Another thing we didn't really note when we bought this. My mistake that I had a preference for LG. It is very quiet though, which is important to me.

Fourth, if you want to readjust the fridge temperature, you will have to press the buttons by shoving your head into the fridge as it is at the back. New designs like Samsung have this on the door.

So think twice. The advantages here are the silent functioning and if you want it, the enormously large third shelf, but there are so many cons in the whole series by LG right now, you might want to consider another brand."

There are minor scratches at the back, but no major damage. Delivery people carefully got the refrigerator to the 4th floor, and I appreciate their efforts. But, LG customer service is pathetic. Technician had come next day to install, did not explain functions clearly. He left the manual with customer copy inside the refrigerator and turned it on. We found it next day when we started loading the fridge. When called the local LG support here, they said they'll look into it. I don't think they're efficient. Technician asked us to pay 11k for extra warranty which is ridiculous. Though we didn't fall for his tricks, they need to stop looting customers. Overall, not very happy with LG. Will definitely not recommend this one or for that matter any LG appliances."

I have undergone six service engineer visits within 1st 3 months of the purchase, with each visit consuming an agonizing 4-5 hours of my time. During these visits, various components of the refrigerator were replaced multiple times, which suggests that the root cause of the problem remains elusive. This situation is wholly unacceptable, and I find it extremely distressing that a renowned brand like LG is unable to provide a satisfactory resolution to a problem that has persisted for so long. Even today, it consistently malfunctions every 10 days, leading to food spoilage and necessitating repetitive part replacements‚Äîall without resolving the recurring issue. This ongoing ordeal has severely disrupted my routine, undermined my faith in LG's reliability, and resulted in substantial inconvenience. This product has failed to meet even the most basic expectations of quality and dependability, leaving me profoundly dissatisfied and disillusioned."

In first visit, technician did some repair and for one 2-3 days there was no problem. But it started again and this time technician visited only to inform that he doesn't have required tools. He left without attending to the complain and asked me not to raise complaint again as he would return in 3-4 days time with the tools (as the tools were to be received from out of station).
That guy never returned but a new problem also started. This time there was condensation in the fridge side of the refrigerator and the complete section was dripping with water. All of my vegetables and fruits got spoiled.
I called up customer care who told me that the complaint of door not getting closed has already been closed by them. So as per them I am not having any issues now. For further assistance, I was asked to call a mobile no of CCO (Manager) 9988077785 who would take care of my problem. Despite of my calling this number umpteenth times no one picked the call.

Now during monsoon season we are experiencing this problem in Mumbai. We contacted LG. LG service person took some photographs of it.

Like many of us, I bought this when I saw a good price drop. There was a discount of around 2000 from the usual price and I paid around 14.5k for the refrigerator. Which looked like a really good buy, initially.

As the days went by. I realised that the cooling of the fridge was not upto the marks. Morover, both the sides of the fridge were making noise when touched. It felt like the fridge was taking earthing from the touch. I filed for replacement and was contacted by the amazon technicial who suggested that it is normal for compressor to make noises. I didn't mind the earthing problem too much. Because I thought it is a minor issue and won't bug me much.

However after few days, the corners of the fridge starting giving literal electric shows ( the image of which is provided above ). I contacted the amazon for replacement and they said they can't replace the product as they don't have the product available with them. They are clearly lying because it was available in stocks after after the call was disconnected and it is still in stock. The catch is it is available at higher price now

They said they can only make refund which means I will get my 14.5k back and I will have to pay around 2k more for the fridge, now. I bought this fridge only because it was available at cheaper price and I have even sold my old working fridge also. I have no option but to buy the fridge at higher price.

I guinenely felt that they gave discount on the unsold defective piece and tried to clear their stock by fooling their customer. It is disappointing and tiresome process. Please beware if you are buying the fridge for cheap price you might end up getting a defective piece and have to waste your precious time in refund/replacement/techinician visits etc."

My experience with the LG 343 L 3 Star Frost-Free Smart Inverter Double Door Refrigerator (2023 Model, GL-S382SPZX) has been an absolute disaster, primarily due to the recurring issue of cooling coil leakage and LG's abysmal service.

Shortly after purchasing this refrigerator, I noticed water pooling beneath it. Upon investigation, it became apparent that the cooling coils were leaking. This led to a constant puddle of water on my kitchen floor, which not only damaged the flooring but also posed a safety hazard.

I contacted LG customer service immediately, hoping for a swift resolution. Unfortunately, my interactions with their service department were frustrating beyond belief. It took them multiple visits to even diagnose the problem correctly. Each time a technician came, they seemed clueless and ill-prepared, often needing to order parts that took weeks to arrive.

To make matters worse, the repairs were never permanent. Despite their assurances, the leakage issue persisted, causing ongoing inconvenience and stress. The refrigerator's performance suffered as a result, with inconsistent cooling and frequent temperature fluctuations, rendering it unreliable for storing perishable items safely.

The ""Express Freeze"" feature, touted as a highlight of this model, was a joke. It failed to function effectively due to the underlying cooling coil problem, leaving me with no confidence in the refrigerator's advertised capabilities.

LG's customer service was equally disappointing. Their representatives were unhelpful, offering vague promises and excuses instead of concrete solutions. I felt like I was constantly chasing them for updates and resolution, wasting hours on the phone and waiting endlessly for callbacks that never came.

In conclusion, the LG GL-S382SPZX refrigerator has been a colossal waste of money and a source of endless frustration. The recurring cooling coil leakage, coupled with LG's incompetent service, has made me regret ever choosing this brand. Save yourself the headache and avoid this model at all costs."

Saddly, In my refrigerator I found these adhesive sticker/tapes all over the refrigerator. Feels kinda cheap . ( Like a buying a lower model car & having just spaces in place of actual functioning buttons ) . Really didn't expected that from Amazon .

But let me tell the if you are planning to buy, Please do not buy from Amazon. The support is pathetic or has become pathetic. I always vouch for Online as you have cheaper and more options, but better pay a little extra but buy from retail.
I ordered this refrigerator, received a manufacturing defect one. While purchasing they show 10 days replacement only but later on they will say only return is possible. They will assign Delhivery to pick up the return and Delhivery will make your life hell, will not come for pick up and will not pick up calls. Amazon will keep rescheduling pick up again and again and this will go on, I approached consumer ministry helpline then only they picked up the product.

Ordered again, thinking may be a one time experience, forgive and move. They delivered the same defective product. We refused to accept using open box inspection option but now they have not refunded my money. Honestly, I have called them over 20 times and each time a different executive says a different thing.
My money is being stucked. Amazon will waste your precious time and energy. Do not Buy from Amazon.
Amazon is excellent for small items but do not buy large or costly appliances or items from Amazon, you will regret it.
If you are lucky, will get good product but in case of any issue get ready to call Amazon 10 times a day everyday.
I even mailed India head Amit, he or his team saw my email and a guy named Adam followed up, it was just a formality. He never meant to help, just a call and sympathy. No solution, never responds to email, just emails asking for feedback.
Go For Retail, Do not buy from Amazon. You can try filpkart but again might throw same case.
Inshort, Avoid Amazon, they are pathetic. If India head is not helping you, how call center executives will help."

I had asked another technician, who was earlier with LG, who came and told us that this is a product defect in designing and you shouldn't pay a single penny for this. However, I ended up helpless. My question to LG is, how do you manage with such disservice to the customers? Within 3 years your product becomes totally useless claiming repairs and charges?

The refrigerator works fine for the initial days (for me it was 11 months), but after that it's just a nightmare.
It's been a year and the refrigerator hasn't worked for total of 60 days.
Evey two or three weeks the refrigerator shows some problem, and stops working, and it is non functional for a months and after several follow up (and several means 2-3 calls per days for atleast 2-3 weeks) with LG team, the refrigerator works of another max of 2-3 weeks (in most of the cases it will stop working in the first week only)

Conclusion: Refrigerator might be good, but LG service is worse and your time to get it fixed is not worth the money you are spending. I would've given negative stars if possible"

Just imagine ‚Çπ40K for something that is guaranteed to last only 1 year. Secondly the service guy placed the order for the part first locally, then as it was not available, order was placed in Bengaluru, there too it's unavailable so now order is placed in Noida, so 5 days now and I do not have a refrigerator.
So please check with the local LG dealer only which fridge has better support. And support is needed as today's electronics are delicate and stupid because they are made with tolerances for failure (servicing business) unlike the old days where quality was the most important."

My recommendation: DO NOT BUY THIS FRIDGE."

Writing this review after 6 months of struggle with LG product. Strongly recommend to not buy LG refrigerator. From day-1 itself, the refrigerator is making loud noise when the compressor picks up. It sounds like my AC. This sound can be heard in the entire house. So I'm not able to use this refrigerator. I raised multiple compliants, but LG ASM said it is normal and they can't do anything about it. So, better stay away from LG refrigerator. After 4 months, there was another fault in the grill circuit and LG technician said to replace the entire grill unit. The video of the fault is attached for ref. Even after CEO escalation, there is no resolution to the problem and the refrigerator is lying idle in my house for last 6 months now. Worst experience I had with LG."

I ordered and paid money during the festive sale, got an exchange offer at 7K for my old fridge and a 1.5K discount for a credit card, our family was so happy. Our old single door refrigerator is working, no scratches, superb cooling, so we thought exchange won't have any problem.

On the scheduled date, the Amazon delivery associates came to pick up the old fridge, they barely looked for inspecting any changes but found our bottom corner fridge has rust on it, ourselves itself dint notice it before. We said to those guys since we live near seashore and corrosion happens naturally since it's been 5 years, after that, they talked to us very rudely and refused to take our fridge. Told us to look at the whole thing and properly inspect if there is actually any physical damage like holes or dents. If rusting is your problem, give a good price of exchange-value instead of 7K.

Those guys never listened to us and told they won't pick, hence the product will get returned, the money will be refunded. We were left helpless, I called Amazon customer care multiple times explained the situation they were also not ready to help at all, saying it's not possible once DA guys rejected.

I was like if our fridge was damaged or not working or corroded visibly where it hampers looks I would have agreed, rusting at bottom of the thin layer where it can be fixed by cleaning can solve the issue. They strictly said NO. Are they expecting a new fridge nothing to happen for an old product? Common guys are sensible, if there is any damage you exchange the price accordingly, else don't offer and disappoint customers.

Anyway, people, I don't want any of them to suffer like me, so please beware if you are buying any big products or exchanging in the so-called multibillion-dollar e-commerce sites."

818,"LG 343 L 3 Star Frost-Free Smart Inverter Double Door Refrigerator (2023 Model, GL-S382SDSX, Dazzle Steel, Convertible with Express Freeze)",Reviewed in India on 10 October 2021,1.0 out of 5 stars,Exploited by Amazon! My money used by Amazon and I did not get the fridge.,"In summation I did not get my dream fridge even after ordering it ""twice""!!___Ya! TWICE!!... And they used my money to make profit without giving me back anything in return... here's how they did it.

Orders 2nd : This is the second time I ordered the same fridge in Great Indian Sale of Amazon (What happened to the first order is written below, that's an interesting read too.).

So this shopping festival began on 03 October 2021, but for Prime members it started on 02 October 2021 i.e. one day before. It offered discount on price from Rs. 38990 to Rs. 35990. So great. There was a 10% discount on HDFC bank cards (yes with an asterisk mark.. don't get fooled, it is maximum 1000 rupees for debit card and 2000 rupees for credit card.. that's it).

On 02 October I tried placing the order and wow! I was offered a cashback of almost Rs. 1500 plus I was gonna use my amazon pay balance etc. So it was coming quite decent. In excitement I made the payment. Yay! I was getting my dream fridge after all...

But no... the payment declined... why?... not because I had no balance in my account, but because there was ""Some technical problem"" from HDFC bank's side. And I was asked to check the next day. Next day came and again I placed the order.... but now the cashback was only 500 rupees and not 1500 rupees. Still I went ahead thinking I was getting a deal better than from a shop anyway. I placed my purchase.

Surprisingly the order came withing 4 to 5 days unlike earlier 10 days delay. So I was very excited. It was very nice to find some lucky marks on the packing box - many dents and a good piercing through the box. I waited for the brand installation guys to unpack it. When they unpacked it, the side of the machine bore a good conspicuous dent. It broke my heart. I was not going to accept any fresh thing that is already damaged. I called up the customer service, which asked for photos etc. And told be that, there is only refund and no replacement. Do you know what that means?

It means you were attracted by Amazon by a bait of discount + cashback + card discount etc. Then made you purchase a large object Costing thousands of rupees, kept your money for 10 days, rolled it around, made profit, then gave you faulty object, apologised for the inconvenience, offered you the refund, but declined to give you the object again at the same price. Thus if you want the fridge, you can book it again at a higher price either from market or amazon. Amazon has thugged you already.

Order 1st: I had made the same order before a few days at rupees 38990 but it wasn't delivered at all. When I first spotted the right fridge LG 335L Dazzle Steel the price was 38450 and then next day it was 38990 when I booked it but after a few day it again became 38450. Wow that was frustrating. But you know when you are a middle class someone you compromise on many levels because you want that dream object. So I still bought it. The update said it would delivered 7 days later. The status showed that the fridge was shipped etc. But on 6th day I got a service call apologising for further delay by 2 days. That's 9 days in total. I thought ok. But it didn't show up even on 10th day. So called the customer service to check what happened to my beloved fridge. They said it was still in a storage facility in ""Rajasthan"", and I live in Maharashtra. I was so frustrated that I cancelled it.

Amazon parked my money amounting to more than 35k for around 20 days. They made profits through their Amazon Pay fund management wing, and gave me nothing but frustration."

859,"LG 594 L Frost-Free Inverter Linear Wi-Fi Side-By-Side Refrigerator (GC-B22FTLPL, Platinum Silver lll, Hygiene Fresh+ | Door Cooling+, 2019 Model)",Reviewed in India on 27 September 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic!! Dont waste your money.,"This has been our worst purchase from LG brand. It has been just about 6-8 mnths since the purchase and we have complained atleast 6 times about the issue with fridge not cooling. They even changed the compressor but issue is still the same. We were asked to move fridge ahead for it to get space behind to cool off, we also did that spending money on platform change thinking it will resolve but still the same. They sent senior engineers but no one has been able to resolve.
All they say is no fault in the Fridge and go back. The fault is with this model I suppose as they dont have a solution!
I would recommend to stay away from such a expensive liability and buy a better brand!"
