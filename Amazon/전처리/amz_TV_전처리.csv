The technician had told that the video port had burned off due to a voltage surge from the set top box. He had showed the burned portion also. As per the warranty I understand that LG doesn't cover issues due to voltage surges. But then, I have been using televisions of other brands like Sony & Panasonic for long and no such issues had occurred while using the same set top box. But just after buying an LG TV, if it burns off then I have to wonder about the quality of the circuit board used by LG. It is possible that the issue occurred due to a faulty board and not a voltage surge. It is unfortunate LG doesn't cover such issues even during the warranty period even though it's only a 2 week old product. It has been a disappointing experience for me with LG and would not ever be buying or recommending an LG product again.","Aug, 2021",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 80 cm HD Ready Smart LED TV 32LM563BPTC

Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.","Oct, 2023",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UR7500PSC
101,"Just a decent TV , nothing amazing !","I got a 55 inch TV thinking I will recieve an IPS panel, but alas I got a VA panel .. and even with a VA panel, the BLACKS aren't that good . The upscaling works very avg , the SD channel aren't even worth watching.
Connectivity is good with wifi has ample ports
The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand . Or you can wait it out for LG UT80 series as they are significantly better having tested it myself in an offline store .","Jul, 2024",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UR7500PSC

111,Defective panel and long ordeal it getting resolution,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.","Jan, 2024",2,Dark Iron Gray,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UR7500PSC

118,Not a great purchase.,"While the picture quality and sound is great.
Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.","May, 2024",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UR7500PSC
119,product good for amazon delivery is worst,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads.

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

169,DO NOT BUY - FAULTY TV WITH PANEL ISSUES,"I recently purchased an LG 65-inch TV via Amazon, excited to upgrade my home entertainment experience. Unfortunately, what arrived was a faulty unit, with the panel flickering incessantly.

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively. It's disheartening to encounter such poor customer service, especially when dealing with a significant purchase like a TV.","Mar, 2024",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UR7500PSC

270,Disappointed by LG,"I had bought a TV on 06/08/21 with serial no: B08DPLCM6T. It worked properly for two weeks and then the video was not available from the AV port. The technician had told that the video port had burned off due to a voltage surge from the set top box. He had showed the burned portion also. As per the warranty I understand that LG doesn't cover issues due to voltage surges. But then, I have been using televisions of other brands like Sony & Panasonic for long and no such issues had occurred while using the same set top box. But just after buying an LG TV, if it burns off then I have to wonder about the quality of the circuit board used by LG. It is possible that the issue occurred due to a faulty board and not a voltage surge. It is unfortunate LG doesn't cover such issues even during the warranty period even though it's only a 2 week old product. It has been a disappointing experience for me with LG and would not ever be buying or recommending an LG product again.","Aug, 2021",1,Black,LG 80 cm HD Ready Smart LED TV 32LQ643BPTA

The technician had told that the video port had burned off due to a voltage surge from the set top box. He had showed the burned portion also. As per the warranty I understand that LG doesn't cover issues due to voltage surges. But then, I have been using televisions of other brands like Sony & Panasonic for long and no such issues had occurred while using the same set top box. But just after buying an LG TV, if it burns off then I have to wonder about the quality of the circuit board used by LG. It is possible that the issue occurred due to a faulty board and not a voltage surge. It is unfortunate LG doesn't cover such issues even during the warranty period even though it's only a 2 week old product. It has been a disappointing experience for me with LG and would not ever be buying or recommending an LG product again.","Aug, 2021",1,Ceramic Black,LG 80 cm HD Ready Smart LED TV 32LQ576BPSA

400,Received Defective Product,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.","Oct, 2023",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UR7500PSC

The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand .

411,Defective panel and long ordeal it getting resolution,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.","Jan, 2024",2,Dark Iron Gray,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UR7500PSC

Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.","May, 2024",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UR7500PSC
419,product good for amazon delivery is worst,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Anyway i prepare Flipkart only for all the major purchases like mobile, laptops so many things but very first time went to amazon but very bad experience","Oct, 2023",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UR7500PSC

We have a 14'x14' room and we have to keep the brightness at 60% else it gets too bright. Vibrant mode is tooo vibrant. We use the standard/film mode so that colors look natural. Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads. But what they don't show is how much the apps lag in animations. I have a firetv stick to compare webOS against.","Nov, 2023",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UR7500PSC

Service guys are claiming that it got damaged from inside. But when we discussed with other TV guys, they ensured that when the display gets bad it shows the same sign. And now they are asking for 27k for repair even when the television is in warranty.

Cons:

2.WEB OS, though said to be improved, but not impressive and not user friendly as Android OS
3.Glitches while using the interface as it is not that fluidic and was somewhat irritating

442,TV with great picture quality but very bad (low) sound quality,"A TV only has two main functions.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Display - 5/5

469,DO NOT BUY - FAULTY TV WITH PANEL ISSUES,"I recently purchased an LG 65-inch TV via Amazon, excited to upgrade my home entertainment experience. Unfortunately, what arrived was a faulty unit, with the panel flickering incessantly.

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively.

2. Lag in loading the videos with the fast internet 5G speed

499,UR7500PSC panel issue,"I got this tv from DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED during dasara sale 2023 which got delivered on Oct 17, since most of the DTH channels are not full screen , I couldn't notice the black wavy curves. but a few YouTube videos are full screen and found it. And also the edges of the tv are not rigid when I press the panel keeps moving inside as if the tv edges are improperly fixed.
I noticed it and quickly raised a complaint.

Surprisingly I spoke with the customer care guys and found out that a request for panel replacement has been raised. I was looking for a piece to piece replacement as it's been hardly 1.5 month and the product it self is defective. Frankly I would say I received a defective product.","Dec, 2023",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UR7500PSC
500,Received Defective Product,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.","Oct, 2023",1,Ceramic Black,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UQ7550PSF
501,"Just a decent TV , nothing amazing !","I got a 55 inch TV thinking I will recieve an IPS panel, but alas I got a VA panel .. and even with a VA panel, the BLACKS aren't that good . The upscaling works very avg , the SD channel aren't even worth watching.
Connectivity is good with wifi has ample ports
The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand . Or you can wait it out for LG UT80 series as they are significantly better having tested it myself in an offline store .","Jul, 2024",3,Ceramic Black,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UQ7550PSF
502,TV quality is good and installation experience is worst,"The TV quality is excellent, but the installation took 5 days.

511,Defective panel and long ordeal it getting resolution,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.","Jan, 2024",2,Ceramic Black,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UQ7550PSF

518,Not a great purchase.,"While the picture quality and sound is great.
Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.","May, 2024",3,Ceramic Black,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UQ7550PSF
519,product good for amazon delivery is worst,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads.

Service guys are claiming that it got damaged from inside. But when we discussed with other TV guys, they ensured that when the display gets bad it shows the same sign. And now they are asking for 27k for repair even when the television is in warranty.

542,TV with great picture quality but very bad (low) sound quality,"A TV only has two main functions.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Display - 5/5
Sound quality - 4/5
Sound loudness - 1/5
Overall - 2.5/5","Oct, 2023",2,Ceramic Black,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 43UQ7550PSF

I have been wasting my time for 2-4 hours for calling amazon and finding LG service center contact details. Finally Indecided and I urged Amazon to take their product and give my refund but they are refusing even for this.

On the unit: the remote was very slow to operate, two of the programs showed weird design patterns after 4-5 minutes of viewing. The installer walked away without explaining the remote (which is really complicated with myriads of buttons). Whenever a wrong button was pressed, I was asked a lot of questions which I could not understand and the TV went into a mode from which only power off was a recovery.

569,DO NOT BUY - FAULTY TV WITH PANEL ISSUES,"I recently purchased an LG 65-inch TV via Amazon, excited to upgrade my home entertainment experience. Unfortunately, what arrived was a faulty unit, with the panel flickering incessantly.

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively.

600,Received Defective Product,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.","Oct, 2023",1,Ceramic Black,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UQ7550PSF

The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand .

602,TV quality is good and installation experience is worst,"The TV quality is excellent, but the installation took 5 days.

1) RECIEVED VA PANEL
2) When I tried checking panel for bleeding using white screen‚Ä¶ it is not uniformly white(Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an issue or not) but no case of screen bleeding..luckily.

611,Defective panel and long ordeal it getting resolution,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.","Jan, 2024",2,Ceramic Black,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UQ7550PSF

618,Not a great purchase.,"While the picture quality and sound is great.
Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.","May, 2024",3,Ceramic Black,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UQ7550PSF
619,product good for amazon delivery is worst,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads.

Cons:

2.WEB OS, though said to be improved, but not impressive and not user friendly as Android OS
3.Glitches while using the interface as it is not that fluidic and was somewhat irritating

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

669,DO NOT BUY - FAULTY TV WITH PANEL ISSUES,"I recently purchased an LG 65-inch TV via Amazon, excited to upgrade my home entertainment experience. Unfortunately, what arrived was a faulty unit, with the panel flickering incessantly.

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively. It's disheartening to encounter such poor customer service, especially when dealing with a significant purchase like a TV.","Mar, 2024",1,Ceramic Black,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UQ7550PSF

And also the edges of the tv are not rigid when I press the panel keeps moving inside as if the tv edges are improperly fixed.
I noticed it and quickly raised a complaint.

Surprisingly I spoke with the customer care guys and found out that a request for panel replacement has been raised. I was looking for a piece to piece replacement as it's been hardly 1.5 month and the product it self is defective. Frankly I would say I received a defective product.","Dec, 2023",1,Ceramic Black,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 55UQ7550PSF
700,Received Defective Product,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.","Oct, 2023",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 126 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 50UR7500PSC
701,"Just a decent TV , nothing amazing !","I got a 55 inch TV thinking I will recieve an IPS panel, but alas I got a VA panel .. and even with a VA panel, the BLACKS aren't that good . The upscaling works very avg , the SD channel aren't even worth watching.
Connectivity is good with wifi has ample ports
The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand .

711,Defective panel and long ordeal it getting resolution,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.","Jan, 2024",2,Dark Iron Gray,LG 126 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 50UR7500PSC

Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.","May, 2024",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 126 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 50UR7500PSC
719,product good for amazon delivery is worst,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Clean crisp & melodic. This one is just the opposite. The soundstage is not clean. The audio has too much of distortion. The mids are not clean. Too much overpowering lows creating distortion for the highs.
Bluetooth is patchy: signal intermittently drops even within 10m LoS range.

729,"Good hardware, not so good software","I'll start with the good parts. Panel is bright, picture quality is great(clear), audio is perfect for us. We have a 14'x14' room and we have to keep the brightness at 60% else it gets too bright. Vibrant mode is tooo vibrant. We use the standard/film mode so that colors look natural. Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads. But what they don't show is how much the apps lag in animations. I have a firetv stick to compare webOS against.","Nov, 2023",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 126 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 50UR7500PSC

Service guys are claiming that it got damaged from inside. But when we discussed with other TV guys, they ensured that when the display gets bad it shows the same sign. And now they are asking for 27k for repair even when the television is in warranty.

3.decent sound output
4.movable TV wall mount for adjusting the viewing angle
5.IPS panel with good blacks and colour optimisation by the processor

Cons:
1.Build quality not upto the mark.. panel gaps between PANEL and bezels are evident
2.WEB OS, though said to be improved, but not impressive and not user friendly as Android OS
3.Glitches while using the interface as it is not that fluidic and was somewhat irritating
4.1.5gb ram 16gb is not enough considering the competition

742,TV with great picture quality but very bad (low) sound quality,"A TV only has two main functions.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Display - 5/5
Sound quality - 4/5

I have been wasting my time for 2-4 hours for calling amazon and finding LG service center contact details.

769,DO NOT BUY - FAULTY TV WITH PANEL ISSUES,"I recently purchased an LG 65-inch TV via Amazon, excited to upgrade my home entertainment experience. Unfortunately, what arrived was a faulty unit, with the panel flickering incessantly.

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively.

797,Great Disappointment! Absolutely Worst Product !,"Bought it after going through many reviews. But unfortunately, and surprisingly the results are totally adverse.
I see various issues in this LG 55‚Äô‚Äô TV. Listing out few below
1. The voice and lip mismatch throughout
2. Lag in loading the videos with the fast internet 5G speed
3. Picture colour quality is extremely low, worst than any cheap local brand TVs

I regret my decision not to return it within the return period. It‚Äôs been 1.1 month , so cannot opt or return.","Mar, 2024",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 126 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 50UR7500PSC

799,UR7500PSC panel issue,"I got this tv from DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED during dasara sale 2023 which got delivered on Oct 17, since most of the DTH channels are not full screen , I couldn't notice the black wavy curves. but a few YouTube videos are full screen and found it. And also the edges of the tv are not rigid when I press the panel keeps moving inside as if the tv edges are improperly fixed.
I noticed it and quickly raised a complaint.

Surprisingly I spoke with the customer care guys and found out that a request for panel replacement has been raised. I was looking for a piece to piece replacement as it's been hardly 1.5 month and the product it self is defective. Frankly I would say I received a defective product.","Dec, 2023",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 126 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 50UR7500PSC
800,Received Defective Product,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.","Oct, 2023",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 164 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 65UR7500PSC
801,"Just a decent TV , nothing amazing !","I got a 55 inch TV thinking I will recieve an IPS panel, but alas I got a VA panel .. and even with a VA panel, the BLACKS aren't that good . The upscaling works very avg , the SD channel aren't even worth watching.
Connectivity is good with wifi has ample ports
The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand . Or you can wait it out for LG UT80 series as they are significantly better having tested it myself in an offline store .","Jul, 2024",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 164 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 65UR7500PSC

811,Defective panel and long ordeal it getting resolution,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.","Jan, 2024",2,Dark Iron Gray,LG 164 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 65UR7500PSC

818,Not a great purchase.,"While the picture quality and sound is great.
Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.","May, 2024",3,Dark Iron Gray,LG 164 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 65UR7500PSC
819,product good for amazon delivery is worst,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

On the unit: the remote was very slow to operate, two of the programs showed weird design patterns after 4-5 minutes of viewing. The installer walked away without explaining the remote (which is really complicated with myriads of buttons). Whenever a wrong button was pressed, I was asked a lot of questions which I could not understand and the TV went into a mode from which only power off was a recovery.

869,DO NOT BUY - FAULTY TV WITH PANEL ISSUES,"I recently purchased an LG 65-inch TV via Amazon, excited to upgrade my home entertainment experience. Unfortunately, what arrived was a faulty unit, with the panel flickering incessantly.

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively. It's disheartening to encounter such poor customer service, especially when dealing with a significant purchase like a TV.","Mar, 2024",1,Dark Iron Gray,LG 164 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV 65UR7500PSC

This TV have issues with Surrond Audio via HDMi ARC with my Sony HT-RT3 5.1 & Sony HT-RT40- No Surround Audio support, Only Stereo audio via HDMI ARC for Sony Home Theatre Soundbar. I tried lot of settings but nothing works. If you want to get Surround 5.1 Audio then you would have to use Optical ( But would not be able to have volume control via Optical)

Tried HDMI HRC with Yamaha AVR, Surround Audio works. So its just Sony & LG.

LG if its your software issues please fix it.

Note : If you use Sony SoundBars then go for Samsung or Sony Models.","Aug, 2023",3,Ashed Blue,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart NanoCell TV 55NANO73SQA
923,Tv is good but had to return it,Lg exchange process is very bad. No problem with Amazon team. But LG sales and service team isn't dedicated towards its customers.

924,Scam,Please save your money and don‚Äôt buy this product. Amazon gave me a faulty product during the independence day sale and refused to replace it and only offered refund despite their 10 day refund policy. On top of that LG is the worst electronics company when it comes to customer care. They don‚Äôt care about their customers at all and only make fake promises. For 3 weeks I spoke to them regarding my tv issue and spoke to more than 10 people constantly everyone also saying they‚Äôll call in one hour. That one hour finished 2 weeks back. They mentally harassed me and drove me insane. Amazon is a scam as they violate their policy rules and LG won‚Äôt care about their customers at all. So yea don‚Äôt buy it try Sony and buy from Flipkart instead they are much better. Cheers,"Sep, 2023",1,Ashed Blue,LG 139 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart NanoCell TV 55NANO73SQA

950,Totally dissappointment,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with LG, and I feel compelled to share my experience in hopes of warning others. From start to finish, the quality of service provided by this brand has been nothing short of abysmal.

Firstly, the display of my TV, which I bought just 6 months ago, broke unexpectedly. When I reached out to LG Service for support, I was shocked to find that they demanded 100% of the TV‚Äôs original cost to fix the broken display. This exorbitant charge is completely unreasonable, especially considering that the TV was still relatively new.

As if the cost wasn't bad enough, the customer service was appalling. The representatives I spoke to were incredibly rude and dismissive. They showed no empathy or willingness to help resolve my issue. Repeated calls for support went unanswered, leaving me frustrated and feeling helpless.

Overall, my experience with LG has been extremely disappointing. The combination of poor service, outrageous repair costs, and rude customer support has convinced me to never purchase from this brand again. I strongly advise others to think twice before investing in a product from LG Brand. There are many other brands out there that offer better quality and customer service.","Jul, 2024",1,Black,LG 108 cm 4K Ultra HD Smart QNED TV 43QNED75SRA
