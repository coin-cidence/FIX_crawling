LG Service Centre - Gurgaon 1,"B-37,38 and 39 IDC Area, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Rd, opp. Sector-14, Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India","We got two split AC installed in April 2024. Now when the rain starts, the out holes in the wall started pouring with rain and one of the AC started leaking internally. To fix it I called the LG customer service and the team assigned me the executive who will fix it. I booked the complaint on 2nd Aug and three days passed and nobody came to fix it. And all I was getting calls to understand my problem and the person who used to call would say it's not our job and another department will call. This kept going for three days. Then I again booked a complaint through LG app and this time two engineers came and I got to know the AC which is leaking internally because the engineer who had installed it didn't insulate the copper pipe properly and now due to high humidity there is a water leakage. These two guys tried to fix the problem but could not because it is not their primary job. It is those guys who aligned my case to their seniors and then some one from the installation team arrived the next day and fixed the insulation problem. Now there was another issue at hand, the rain water. And to my surprise got some more brand new information that LG provides putty to fill the wall holes when AC are installed but at the time of installation I was not told because it cost extra so they assumed I will be ok with half the job. Now it can't be done internally, someone has to climb up the ladder from outside to fill these holes. And one more thing while taking these pipes out there has to be a vertical bend given to these out pipes so that the rain water does not sweep into the hole and guess what that is also not done. LG didn't fix that problem and I had to ask some other people to fix it, pay extra for it. And payment is not at all the issue because as we live on the 4th floor it is a risky job. Because of LG incompetent service guys I had to risk the life of someone else.
And to their audacity LG called me a couple of times for the feedback and said next time they will be more careful. ""Next time"" getting AC installed is not my day to day job. What will they improve for me next time. There is no next time, neither will I recommend LG to anyone. It's not a failure of one team, it's LG in whole that has failed overall. I wish there was a negative rating.
THE MOST IRRITATING THING IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS WAS THE GUY WHO INSTALLED THE AC'S INITIALLY BOOSTED ABOUT HIS WORK AND GAVE ME HIS PERSONAL NUMBER FOR ANY FUTURE ISSUES AND WHEN I CALLED HIM HE DIDN'T RESPOND AND I EVEN TEXTED HIM WITH A ""PLEASE"", DIDN'T BOTHER TO REPLY BACK ABOUT WHATEVER IT WAS .",1,swati koul,2024-08-14 18:05:02,2024-08-14,08,2024
LG Service Centre - Gurgaon 1,"B-37,38 and 39 IDC Area, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Rd, opp. Sector-14, Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India","The AC replacement was agreed upon by Mr. Sandeep (Team Leader) and Mr. Nimesh Bansal (Dy. Manager) on March 29th. Mr. Bansal also confirmed that the replacement will be done by April 1st, as this model is not in their warehouses. On 1st April no activity took place then I inquired from Mr. Bansal about the commitment, on which a reply was received from Mr. Sandeep on April 2nd that replacement of the ac is approved but the model is unavailable in their warehouses, so there will be a delay in the replacement, and the model will come from the current production batch. Meanwhile, we kept on enduring the summer heat. Finally, on April 6th the ac arrived, but to our surprise the manufacturing date was JUNE 21st, 2023 (previous year and not current batch). To which objection was raised against the excuses put by Mr. Sandeep/Mr. Nimesh for prolonging the replacement due to nonavailability of the unit and harassing us with this deceitful commitment by them. For this reason, we refused to accept the replacement. On this, Mr. Nimesh committed to get the bill amount refunded after the return of one AC unit. Then the AC unit was returned/handed over to the delivery person along with the signed delivery challan.

MR. NIMESH BANSAL HAS NOT HELD UP HIS END OF THE COMMITMENT TILL APRIL 23rd 2024. HE STATED THAT ""Refund Cheque will handover to you in next 15-20 days."" THIS WAS DATED APRIL 6TH 2024. THIS IS A LAPSE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE BY LG INDIA.",1,Raghav Gupta,2024-04-23 11:48:58,2024-04-23,04,2024

LG Service Centre - Delhi 5,"Plot no B/12, Pocket 3, Sector 17 Dwarka, Dwarka, New Delhi, Delhi, 110075, India","Did not have a worst experience in my life than this. They are yet to rectify the fault of our 17 kg automatic washing machine though the complaint was lodged more than 20 days back. Their engineers does not seems to be competent enough  and  are trying to rectify it through hit and trial method. First they said door lock was faulty and replaced it. Then it was said the PCB was faulty and did not turn up for 7 days. We got the PCB checked through a private engineer and it was found ok. We informed them accordingly and they said that if pcb is ok then the wire harness needs a change and they did change it after a few days.  When the machine did not still work they said a small magnet needs a change. Now we are waiting for the arrival of that part. When enquired the stock reply is that they have placed an order and hope to get it soon. This a classic example that how the reputation of the companies of international repute can be spoilt by us.
Edit of the review : Ultimately the technician arrived with the magnet after a week's time. When confronted to show where it was to be placed, we found that the magnet was already there and it needed some adjustment. His plea was the model which we were having was costly and is sold less and that is why they are not aware about its intricacies. I withheld the payment as I wanted to meet their branch head.
I want to make a request to google maps to make a provision for zero star rating as sometimes you don't want to give even one star as in this case where our complaint was addressed after almost a month's time.
Editing of review: Met the branch today on 04.05.22. Explained our grievance and paid the bill.",1,S S Josan,2022-05-04 20:35:18,2022-05-04,05,2022

LG Coolx Enterprises,"Deva Ram Park, 1145/75, Tri Nagar, New Delhi, Delhi 110035, India","Date 23rd july 2020
Two guys came from LG coolx Mr. Sandeep Singh (Engineer) and Jagtar Singh (Helper) to install the AC around 16:30 hrs, and the work done by them is DISASTROUS.

Neither of them were following the guidelines pertaining to COVID - 19. I was the only one repeatedly telling them to wear a mask. Not just this, they did not have any identity proof with them. You can see them admitting in the video that HR failed to provide them with company IDs and that they are protecting their neck with mask rather than covering their nose and mouth.
We already have three ACs installed at our home, but the kind of work which is done this time is really not appreciable.

No precautions, no gloves, and no sanitizer with them.

I live with my parents, and all three of us are allergic to dust. I am doing all the mopping work because of the havoc that has been created by them.

THEIR POORLY PERFORMED TASK HAS ACTUALLY DAMAGED MY WALL. WHO WILL BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAME?

After getting extremely disturbed with the mess up created by the two employees of LG, I decided to raise the issue because as a customer what I had to face is entirely wrong and shouldn't happen to anyone else. So, I seek your help here and informed Mr. Pawan Mishra (Accounts) about the entire scenario and also shared the videos and photographs via WhatsApp. I was directed towards Mr. Harpreet (Manager, LG) by him. He assured me that he'll take action and told me that he is sending another team for my work.

I received a call from Mr. Amrish (Manager of Coolx) at 18:30 hrs to take feedback regarding the services done. It was then, I again informed him regarding the mess created by the AC technician and the helper. Also, that no one came to install the TV yet. Mr. Harpreet was also in loop during this time.

To avoid having so many wires all over the place, we have made a direct connection near the AC for safety and security purposes. And the engineer who was representing LG - Sandeep Singh said that we have been ordered strictly not to do any kind of electrical work. I simply asked him to do the connection in a proper way for which he denied and asked me to call my electrician.
Testing was done for the AC, but please clarify who will be clearing up the mess that they have created?
You can clearly see in the video how other ACs are installed in a proper manner and have a direct connection. They are LG products too.

I clearly notified Mr. Harpreet of not paying for all of this. And I was told by him that a team will be coming for the sanitization of my house.
It was 19:00 hrs and there was no update regarding the team who was supposed to come for installation of TV.

""LG"" I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW DOES THAT FALL UNDER WORKING HOURS TO VISIT CUSTOMER'S PLACE???
The new team for TV installation came around 19:30 - 20:00 hrs. Mr. Sudhir (Engineer) and Mr. Jaggi (Helper) along with the sanitization equipment‚Äôs. This time One of them had an Employee ID card & the other didn't.
They wore gloves only after I asked them. Unfortunately, the sanitization team failed to perform the task properly that they were supposed to do. Neither he was aware of the functioning of it nor the operational methods. It was leaking throughout which is clearly visible in the video.

The kind of service that has been provided, especially by such an esteemed brand LG is unacceptable. None of them were professional in their given field of work.
Is this the kind of training they get?

A customer who is spending lakhs in his purchases, is this kind of service we should expect in return?
After this entire incident, I am very sure neither am I going to purchase anything from LG nor recommend anyone.
At last, I received a call from Mr. Amrish & Mr. Harpreet to pay the amount.

MY QUESTION TO LG IS WHY I SHOULD PAY FOR SUCH A CARELESS ND TERRIBLE SERVICE.

NOTE :

I would request you all to please take the necessary action by giving proper training to your employees instead of firing any of them, and let this be a learning experience. Because of the word limt i'm attaching sm pictures.

LG Best Shop (Jeevanjee Refrigeration Engineers),"K-40,Lajpat Nagar II near central market home saaz delhi, New Delhi, Delhi 110024, India","Absolutely pathetic service, don't be fooled by the other reviews. I bought a 655L LG refrigerator from them, costing nearly about a lakh, and in less than a year it started malfunctioning. Every time we requested the shop to look into it, they did nothing and it's me who has to stay on call with LG service centre (who again send substandard technicians who don't know what to do). This has happened thrice already in about 6-7 months. After selling the machine they wash off all the responsibility regarding the machine from their hands, and you're on your own. They claim it's not their responsibility to repair it or exchange despite it being well under warranty, and now I'm the one making calls all over India to arrange exchange and get the work done. And this is happening while I stay in South Delhi, one can very well imagine the type of service they give elsewhere. Never buy anything from these people, all they know is to look the other way once you make the payment. Beware.
(I bought the fridge in November of 2023 and now it's June of 2024: in a few months my exchange warranty will get over. I don't know whether my machine will ever get exchanged, and close to 1 lakh rupees completely wasted). I hope this review stays on top so that people know not to come here.",1,ARUNDHATI PAHARI,2024-06-27 17:29:54,2024-06-27,06,2024

They don't even bother to follow up on customer's issues nor do they work on resolving issues. The only thing they bother is to close their service requests in order to fetch money/vouchers from LG company. They really do not care about customers at all. I would not recommend this customer center nor LG for split AC.
They were forcing me to close the request every other day, however my issue was not resolved.
I purchased a new LG 2 tonne AC on April 4, 2024. However the AC stopped working, stopped cooling after 20days. After I raised a complaint, their lazy engineers came and just did ON & OFF the a.c and said its working fine and he pushed to close the complaint. However the colling was still not working, and I myself found and troubleshooted the problem that there was some issue with the external unit as the eternal units fan used to turn off after a few minutes.
Then I raised another complaint and then I had to reproduce the issue and convince their incompetent service engineers that so and so is the issue, there after they agreed that yes there is some problem. Then they visited 4 times and tried to resolve the issue but failed. Then I demanded the replacement.
I really had to fight and follow up with Sai Enterprises and LG customer care to get the AC replacement.
I brought the AC during peak summer. However it did not work then and now they are giving me a replacement in monsoon season where we know it won't be of any use. They have just wasted my warranty period and my efforts.

Request anyone to please lookout for some other third party agency to fix your AC even if it‚Äôs in warranty period and give peace to your mind.,1,SIDD mahajan,2023-03-03 21:31:31,2023-03-03,03,2023

One of their service personnel promised me to install my ac but they transferred their installation to some other service centre without even informing me and without even my consent. And one of their executive Sachin Dalvi he told me he has transferred the request to Jovees but when i called them they said no request was received. Pathetic co ordination of LG service centre. I have mailed CEO office LG about this bad co ordination a customer has to go through even after paying hefty amount .

doesn‚Äôt repair properly and if we ask for the same, says ‚Äú itna hi ho payega, isse jada nahi hoga‚Ä¶ thoda toh chalta hai ‚Ä¶‚Äù

These are their words.

My tv screen color was not visible, technician named Ashish says we need to change 2 circuits and thats machine fitted. So needs extra care and all.

We agreed and gave tv for repair
Next day he comes with repair and tv color is green one side and one side blue shade.

I refused to accept the service, i asked for re-repair then he says ‚Äútv chalu ho gaya na, itna toh chalta hai‚Äù

I refused to do full payment and then he said let me try.  He did soldering of  chip and first place he never changed the circuits that he was explaining tht needs to be changed by machine.

Fooled customers and the bill was 4500.

However after soldering green shade was correct but very next day tv turn in purple/ pink color.

I called for home visit and relook the tv.

lg hitech service,"23 kalyani Amman street varatharajapuram ambattur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600053, India","Do not buy LG products if you are in Ambattur, Chennai, TN. Poor service in this region.

As this is the only authorized service center for LG Ac's in Ambattur region, they behave rudely to customers queries. Prefer not to buy any LG product if you are in Ambattur region especially. Some service technicians are not even aware how to make a proper drill in your wall and fit the templates. The guy who came for installation made a 25cm dia hole that too in the lintel level exactly above window. Also, he charged me a separate amount (250rupees) for adding a white tape to copper wire (FYI: White tape comes with your new unit - he cheated here for the first time). and for L-angle he charged me around 900 rupees (This would cost only 650-700 rupees per retailer - Second cheating). And when we reported all these issues to the team head he said you have paid and you cant do anything now.

After buying my AC in 1-2 months the gas in the cylinder got reduced due to leakage and I raised complaint through customer care LG. They (Service technicians from Hitech services) came back and refilled gas, but in job sheet they wrote just like it is a general service (Cheating third time). After 5-6 months I had a requirement to dismantle and reinstall at different location. Again it was given to hitech services and these guys made a mess again.

While we are still evaluating the product and its performance (65QNED-88T), i can only reflect on my positive and hasslefree experience with this showroom. They have given us a good customer experience overall. I would strongly recommend purchases with them (considering their direct dealership with LG) vs other electronics shops around.

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Alert‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èWorst ExperienceüíØ

I recently visited the LG store in Porur and had a terrible experience. Initially, everything seemed fine, but things quickly went downhill when I interacted with the staff, especially Viji and the manager, Venkatesh.

Viji quoted one price for a product when I asked, but when I decided to buy it, the price suddenly increased. This felt like a trick to get more money from me.

Additionally, there was a hidden discharge fee that Viji did not mention at first. This hidden fee was a nasty surprise and felt very unfair.

When I called the store to discuss these issues, Viji and Venkatesh were extremely rude. Instead of helping, they shouted at me over the phone. This behavior was unacceptable and made the situation even worse.

Venkatesh, the manager, was very unprofessional. He showed no interest in solving the problem and seemed to care little about customer satisfaction. This is not what you expect from a manager.

Viji was also untrustworthy. Her lack of transparency about the prices and hidden fees made me feel cheated. She seemed more focused on making a sale than being honest with customers.

I left the store feeling very frustrated and upset. It was one of the worst shopping experiences I've ever had. The staff's disrespect and the hidden fees were shocking.

I strongly advise anyone thinking of buying from the LG store in Porur to reconsider. The customer service is terrible, and the staff cares more about making money than helping customers.

My experience was awful, and I hope others can avoid the same frustration. Businesses should treat customers with respect and honesty, but this store does not.

The rude behavior, hidden fees, and deceptive pricing make this store a bad choice for anyone. I hope my review warns others about these issues.

In conclusion, avoid the LG store in Porur. The staff is rude and untrustworthy, and the hidden charges are a big problem. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this store to anyone.

My experience was a nightmare, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. There are better places to shop where you will be treated with respect and honesty.

I hope my review helps others avoid the same issues I faced. Don't waste your time and money at this store.

Instead, find a store that values its customers and provides honest, transparent service. You deserve better than what the LG store in Porur offers.

Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make an informed decision.",1,EverGreen,2024-06-22 17:37:04,2024-06-22,06,2024

Galaxy Electronics - Samsung LG & Sony LED LCD TV Service / Stabilizer Service Centre,"No 108 Jothi Complex Paper Mills Road Peravallur Near Peravallur, Junction, Kamaraj Statue, Agaram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600082, India","Hi. Its your friendly neighbourhood guide , Chan. My Sanyo LED TV had started to freeze and have bands of multiple colors on the display a couple of months ago. Sanyo doesn't have their own service center and the service is taken care of by Panasonic personnel. The technician from Panasonic just took a look and immediately said the display has to be changed which would cost me around 20k ( guess he had some superhuman chitti like prowess for detecting faults ) and collected Rs. 400 as inspection charge. I chose to get a second opinion. And seeing that galaxy electronics had good reviews ( more so that they were located nearby ) I got in touch with them and they immediately responded by sending a technician, whom I expected to at least open and inpect the TV. Guess what? He takes a look and Voila! Gets the same prowess that the previous techie had and said it was better to exchange the TV since the problem can't be rectified and only the display has to be changed. ( At that point was seriously contemplating if all of them were one big group. Lol!) Jokes aside, I paid the Rs. 300 inspection charge and bid him adieu. Now I have a TV thats frozen and am lesser by 700 bucks. Guess its only me to blame for expecting anything more. Wishing you guys never have problems with your TVs.

Despite numerous calls and requests, no one has bothered to fix it. They won't even reach out; it's always up to you to follow up every single day.

I even spoke with the team lead, Dinesh, whose response was utterly unprofessional and showed no concern for my situation.

LG Customer Care Bangalore,"7th A Cross Rd, C.V. Raman Nagar, Kaggadasapura, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560093, India","THIS IS A SCAM!
PLEASE DO NOT FALL FOR THIS!!!!!!
My first question when the technician stepped on my door step was ""Are you an authorized LG Technician?"" The reason for my question was he had no uniform and wass carrying an urban company bag. And the person mentioned ""Yes"".
My freezer was not working and hence wanted to get it fixed and like fool without even checking the reviews called these people thinking they are from LG.
I was charged 4200/- for the freezer fan and I was told that the compressor will take some time to start working and the so called technician left. I waited for 30min yet the fridge did not switch on so I called the technician to come and have a look. By God's grace, he showed up in next 22min and then mentioned the motherboard was gone. I was slightly doubtful here and call the LG person who helped me in getting the the fridge 3 years ago. He requested me to share the complaint number and when I asked for it the technician was clueless so I called the customer care and when asked the call was disconnected. I tried calling them multiple times and no one responded. By this time, the technician had left my place to get the motherboard board. I had no other go but call the technician to know what was happening. He received the call and when I asked him about the complaint number he said the team will provide you so I asked him if this was a SCAM? he got offended and said that he'd return my amount of I was thinking so. So I asked him to return my account keeping his 350/- of visiting charges and I really need to thank all the Daivaas and Deevas because I was lucky enough to get my money back.

The screen of my LG monitor'a screen had cracked, and I reached out to their service team for assistance.

The technicians who attended to my monitor were not only courteous but also displayed a high level of technical expertise. Their professionalism and knowledge in handling the repair were commendable. They successfully replaced the screen, and I found the charges for this service to be quite reasonable.

However, it's worth noting that the repair process took slightly longer than anticipated, exceeding the expected timeframe by 10 days. Despite this delay, the overall quality of the service and the demeanor of the technicians left me with a positive impression.

In summary, I am satisfied with the service provided by LG's team. Their technical proficiency and polite manner made up for the extended repair time.

LG Electronics India Pvt Ltd,"Panvel - Kochi - Kanyakumari Hwy, Kavu Nagar, Kozhikode, Kerala 673016, India","‚ö†Ô∏è  DO NOT BUY LG LCDs. ...
We are using LG products for past few years. Almost all our home appliances are of the brand LG. We are still using a 6 year old LG washing machine ""inventor DD 6kg' with out any hassle. We are still using a 2 year old  LG refrigerator ' I L 547 ltrs' with out even a call to the LG service. We are also having a LG  UHD 55 inch TV 3&half years old 'which becomes one of the major failure for us. The service persons with out even visiting came to a conclusion that the lcd panel of the TV is damaged and to be replaced with a cost of 45 thousand,since we don't have the coverage of the extended warranty after 3 years. The AMC premium is 13 thousand per year. Is it possible for a person to take additional AMC for each year with a huge premium after buying the TV with a huge amount. It costs about more than one lac with out discount. Is it fair the life span of a LG TV costing more than one lac is  less than four years ü§î. We usually recommend LG products to the people in and around us.
Now we strongly disagree and discourage  anybody who is buying LG  products especially costly Televisions. We are warning every person not to go for  LG go for a better brand which  give you more life span and good service.",1,anoop roy Kurian,2022-05-13 18:03:38,2022-05-13,05,2022

LG Best shop-SKYMART ELECTRONIC,"M.K Tower, opp. Budget Hypermarket, Varangode, Down Hill, Malappuram, Kerala 676519, India","Skymart Electronics is the best LG showroom in Malappuram city located in Malappuram Downhill before reaching Melmuri on the route from Malappuram to Kozhikode. Skymart guarantees an enviable collection of LG brand electronics. To be precise, not only LG's home appliances, but also other electronic gadgets are available at Skymart at affordable and reasonable prices. In other words, not only home appliances like television, AC, fridge, washing machine, mixer, but also wireless headphones associated with smart phones are provided to the customers by Skymart at attractive low-cost EMI terms.  Skymart also offers 10% to 15% discount through leading credit cards. The main attraction is the market leading LG Tone Free headphones for Meridian. Then I was impressed by LG's XBOOM Mini DJ sound system. XBOOM has the power for a small concert or party. The main attraction here is the price that will not tear your pocket. Leaving aside the praises of LG Electronics, let's talk more about Skymart. Skymart is a very customer friendly company. The young man who is the manager will impress us with his behavior, speech and service.  Other staffs are not bad either. Skymart is not just a home appliances shop that sells us good quality products, they deliver the purchased products responsibly to our homes and end their service after installing them. Skymart is also a large showroom with good stock, where customers can select and buy products according to their taste in a nice atmosphere, with good parking space away from the hustle and bustle of the city. They ensure good response and service to queries and queries online or through phone calls. In short, Skymart is one of those rare shops where a customer can walk away satisfied after one purachase.

I'm writing this review as a warning to others after a frustrating experience with LG Shoppe - Das Agency. The agency's unprofessional behavior, false promises, and poor customer service have left me disappointed.

Delivery Delays:

The agency lied about the delivery timeline, promising to deliver the AC within a certain timeframe. However, it arrived much later than promised, causing inconvenience and disrupting our plans.

Poor Customer Service:

When we reached out to Mr. Manoj, he treated us poorly and blocked our number after just two follow-up calls. This level of disrespect and unprofessionalism is unacceptable.

Warning to Others:

I strongly advise against purchasing from LG Shoppe - Das Agency. Their false promises, misleading product information, and poor customer service make them an unreliable and untrustworthy business partner.

I was told I'd receive a callback within 30 minutes, but that never happened. To make matters worse, I was also promised a WhatsApp message update, which never came. Very frustrating experience.
